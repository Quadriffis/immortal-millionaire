# Develop flexibility

**Recipe**

1. Choose stretching routines
	- Treat them as normal length workouts
	- 3x per week 1 hour is optimal
2. Stick with them for at least 6-12 months
3. Decrease intensity as you reach your desired flexibility

**Tools**

The best flexibility training schedule I've experienced is Gymnastics Strength Training (GST)[^I used https://www.gymnasticbodies.com. Specifically their fundamentals 1].

## Why and how this works

While strength and stamina receive a lot of attention in pop culture the attribute of mobility is not as prominent.

- Flexibility refers to the ability to stretch into certain positions
- Mobility refers to being able to stretch while maintaining strength

Flexibility tends to be static whereas the goal of mobility is to be able to use the body to move comfortable through physical motions. Their training should go hand in hand.

Optimally the human body should be able to move in any number of ways that are in our society anything but standard. Many people are not even able to touch their toes while keeping their legs straight.

### Gymnastics strength training

Personally I have had great experiences with the GST approach. It takes principles from gymnastics and translates them into gym-friendly workouts that increase your flexibility and mobility hand in hand.

The program is quite insense though and for a good few months had me doing daily workouts. The results are astonishing and I highly recommend this program to anyone who takes developing flexibility and mobility seriously.

If anything this program is a good way to go from your current level to the level you desire to achieve. I found doing a workout every day unfeasable for me personally, but highly recommend following the program for as long as needed to get to your desired level. After that you can institute maintenance routines.

Some observations:

- Flexibility develops slowly as connective tissue changes over weeks
- Your range of motion often ends up being 'stuck' for a while, and then suddely develops dramatically seemingly over night
- You will need some special equipment (that is available in most gyms or cheap to get)
- Some exercises require things like gymnastics rings. I ended up using whatever was a close to the instruction video that was available in my gym
