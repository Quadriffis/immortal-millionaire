# Develop flexibility

Proposed infographics:

- Have two comic windows, the first filled with a person 'shopping' for stretching routines and the second where they are in a gym working out (clock in the corner showing 1 hour)
- Have a crossed out calendar that shows inprovement somehow
- Show a window similar to the first workout one where the clock shows 30 minutes

1. Choose stretching routines
	- Treat them as normal length workouts
	- 3x per week 1 hour is optimal
2. Stick with them for at least 6-12 months
3. Decrease intensity as you reach your desired flexibility (or don't and keep developing)

## Tools

The best flexibility training schedule I've experienced is Gymnastics Strength Training (GST)[^I used https://www.gymnasticbodies.com. Specifically their fundamentals 1].

## Why and how this works

While strength and stamina receive a lot of attention in pop culture the attribute of mobility is not as prominent.

- Flexibility refers to the ability to stretch into certain positions
- Mobility refers to being able to stretch while maintaining strength

Flexibility tends to be static whereas the goal of mobility is to be able to use the body to move comfortable through physical motions. Their training should go hand in hand.

Optimally the human body should be able to move in any number of ways that are in our society anything but standard. Many people are not even able to touch their toes while keeping their legs straight.

### Gymnastics strength training

Personally I have had great experiences with the GST approach. It takes principles from gymnastics and translates them into gym-friendly workouts that increase your flexibility and mobility hand in hand.

The program is quite insense though and for a good few months had me doing daily workouts. The results are astonishing and I highly recommend this program to anyone who takes developing flexibility and mobility seriously.

If anything this program is a good way to go from your current level to the level you desire to achieve. I found doing a workout every day unfeasable for me personally, but highly recommend following the program for as long as needed to get to your desired level. After that you can institute maintenance routines.

Some observations:

- Flexibility develops slowly as connective tissue changes over weeks
- Your range of motion often ends up being 'stuck' for a while, and then suddely develops dramatically seemingly over night
- You will need some special equipment (that is available in most gyms or cheap to get)
- Some exercises require things like gymnastics rings. I ended up using whatever was a close to the instruction video that was available in my gym

## How I found out

Flexibility has never been my strong suit. My friends in highschool all assumed I was flexible because I did trampolineing, presumably because they thought it was like gymnastics. The reality was though that touching my toes with my legs straight has been hard or impossible for me at different times in my life.

As I started feeelancing and developing a professional carreer I started being plagued by back and neck pain. I later found out back issues are prevalent in both my mother and fathers families to different degrees.

I remember one incident where I was sitting against a wall cross legged when suddenly - boom! - my back exploded in excruciating pain. For a good 3 days walking hurt, getting dressed hurt and pretty much everything other than lying flat hurt (and even that a little).

As any sane person would I visited a physiotherapist specialising in back pain within days of being able to walk again. He looked at me, had me do some postures and proclaimed we'd get things fixed in no time. Two times a week I visited the practice and was guided through a number of exercises.

Most of the exercises though focused on strength and joints:

- Deadlift motions withoug weight
- Lifting arms and legs on all fours
- Bending the back on all fours
- And so on

While I did start to feel better, I could feel that my back was not doing ok. From the way my muscles felt during the exercises I concluded that my hamstrings and core muscles were very tight.

Of course I followed the advice of my fysiotherapist, but could not resist reading some books on the topic of flexibility, mobility and injury proofing.

Through this search I found a book called Becoming a Supple Leopard which pulled into question most things I knew about how a body should move. This book told me all the sensical things that no gym coach or therapist had articulated to me. From body posture under stress to flexibility with relaxed muscles being a wrong approach.

Meanwhile I started trying all sorts of flexibility approaches, from the things I found in books to daily yoga classes at six in the morning.

I started to put these practices to use, but still nothing really clicked. That is until I found out about a Coach Christopher Sommer. A former US national gymnastics coach with strong and unconventional views on what a normal healthy human body should be able to do.

He extrapolated his gymnastics philosophy into a set of workout routines designed to help both couch potatos and inflexible muscleheads to develop strong flexibility. Coach Sommer doesn't believe in strength and flexibility being isolated properties of the body. His workouts are designed for what he calls mobility, the application of strength in all relevant angles.

I started his gymnastics strength training series called Foundation and Stretch. These two had me in the gym multiple times a week for a good hour doing all sorts of stretches and strenth exercises.

In the beginning the whole thing was pure torture. Every 45 minute workout had me miserable. What kept me going is that after the actual workout, my body felt absolutely wonderful. For the first few weeks I seemed not to progress at all. Then suddenly one day I was able to touch my toes.

Another few weeks passed without progress. Then seemingly out of the blue I had no issue whatsoever bringing my face to my knee with a straight leg. Time progressed and before I knew it I had been training for a good 6 months and my body felt like it never had.

After the first few intense months I modified the workout into a short daily session I do to maintain my body's mobility. I have never since had any significant back pain and people compliment me on 'being such a flexible person' and complimenting me on my 'yoga workouts'.
