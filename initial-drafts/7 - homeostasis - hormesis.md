# Hormesis: overcompensation

The body is a system that responds to stimuli by trying to compensate. For example if you drink too much alcohol your liver will grow in size in an attempt to protect you from this toxin.

These systems however can often be triggered by regularly harmless stressors. In many cases the defense response is higher than that of the initial stressor or toxin.

In other words, the body evolved to be able to handle the following flow of events:

1. Something is causing us harm (e.g. toxins like alcohol)
2. We should defend ourselves (e.g. stimulate liver growth)

In many cases however we can use this system to our benefit:

1. Tell the body we are under attack (e.g. sit in a sauna)
2. The body compensates by producing defenses (e.g. heat schock proteins)
3. After our sauna session the perceived harm is gone, but we keep the defense measures.

This section covers things you can expose your body to in a controlled fashion that can result in net positive effects.

## Heat exposure

This is not about food, but rather temperature stressors. The body gains a lot of benefit from controlled extreme heat exposure (sauna).

Particularly saunas are in many countries relatively easy to implement as habits through gyms that offer them.

Benefits of saunas include:

- Improved cardiovascular function
- Increased blood flow
- Increases red blood cell count
- Metabolic improvements (oxygen transport, heat shock proteins)
- Enhanced endurance
- Improved muscle growth (paired with exercise)
- Growth hormone release (downstream effects on mTOR and FOXO pathways)
- Increased insulin sensitivity
- Increased life span (in animals)
- Neurogenesis[^neurogenesis]() in the brain (through BDNF[^bdnf]())

As for frequency, research so far seems to indicate that more is better. Going twice a week beats once, going 5 times beats 4, etc.

## Cold exposure

The oposite of controlled heat exposure, controlled extreme cold exposure (ice baths), also confers a number of benefits.
