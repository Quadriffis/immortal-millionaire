# Having your money make money

Investing is giving money now to get more later. Let's say I have 10 chickens that produce an egg a day each, which I can sell for €10 to my neighbours. That means I have a €10 daily income. This would equal 10*365 = €3650 a year.

You have €1000 available to invest. You offer to give me this €1000,- in return for 25% of my eggs (which would give you €2.50 every day).

> When you buy shares in a company, you are buying their future profits.

This would give you 2.50*365 = €912.50 every year. So after 2 years you would have €1825 which is a lot more that the €1000 you gave me. So why would I agree to trading your money for 25% of the profits? Well perhaps I:

1. Want to buy more chickens so I make even more money
2. I am short on cash and need money now rather than later
3. I took out a loan to buy the chickens, and want to pay it back

It's a silly example, but this is the basic mechanic of how the stock market operates.

# Individual assets are risky

Let's say we buy 5 of the 100 stocks of Acme Incorporated. This means we own 5% of the company and have a right to 5% of their profits every year.

So long as Acme does well we will gain 5/100 = 5% of their substantial profits. But what if Acme goes bankrupt? Then we lose it all...

## Index funds for stocks

Instead of buying shares in a company, we can buy shares of an index fund.

> An index fund buys the top performing companies in a region/sector.

For example the S&P 500 index fund buys shares in 500 big and reliable companies on the US market. If you buy 1 share in the S&P 500 index you in essence own a small portion of 500 companies.

> An index fund like the S&P 500 is basically like betting on the 500 companies that have proven to generate profits.

Why is this good? If one of the companies fails, the other 499 are still up and running. You spread your risk across many ventures without having to manage a complex share portfolio. Examples of an index 'market' are:

- Big US companies (S&P 500)
- Smaller companies that look like they will grow (Vanguard Global Small Cap)
- Sustainable companies (Sustainable Europe Index Fund)
- Companies in healthcare (Vanguard Health Care Index Fund)

## Bond index funds

You can also lend money to governments and corporations. These loans are called bonds You offer the bond issuer money right now, and they promise to give you back a set amount later. Common bond issuers are governments and corporations.

> A government bond allows you to give a government money, and at the end of the term (e.g. a year) they give you back more.

So what if a government can't pay you back? It has happened before (Greece, Iceland etc) and will certainly happen again. You can buffer against this by buying an index of bonds.

A share of a bond index means you are investing small amounts in many bonds at the same time. If you invest in a bond index you are at less risk of a government failing to pay their debts.

# Why the rich get richer

When you invest, your returns will be compounded. This year you get returns on your money, next year you get returns on the returns of last year as well! **This is way more powerful than you think.**

> €100 invested in the S&P 500 in 1928 would be €328,645.87 in 2016

One could argue that the above is an extreme example, but the concept holds true. Compound interest gives you more money the longer you have it invested.

Here are some demo calculations (assuming 4% returns):

| Monthly investment | Years | Total invested | Outcome |
| ------------------ | ----- | -------------- | ------- |
| €500 | 30 | €180,000 | €349,970 |
| €500 | 40 | €240,000 | €592,959 |
| €1000 | 30 | €360,000 | €699,940 |
| €1000 | 40 | €480,000 | €1,185,918 |

## Fees are dangerous!

Don't take your bank/broker fees for granted.

They have a huge impact. My provider charges me a yearly fee of 0.15% for example. Have a look at the impact of fees if you invest €100,000 for 30 years with a 7% return rate.

| Invested | Fee | Outcome |
| -------- | --- | ------- |
| €100,000 | 1%  | €574,349 |
| €100,000 | 2%  | €432,194 |
| €100,000 | 3%  | €324,340 |

The difference between a fee of 1% and 3% is **over €100,000**! Take your time to find a good provider that charges low fees. it will pay off massively in the long term.

# How to actually do it

## 1: Decide on a strategy and stick to it

Humans are not good at managing emotions when it comes to money. Since the stock market it bound to go up and down, you need to make sure you buffer against making bad decisions.

If for example there is a downturn in the financial market, you should not allow yourself to even consider selling any of your investments. Not if you set up a good diversified strategy.

If you want to talk to a financial advisor, be sure to talk to a fiduciary, not just any financial advisor. See video below.

## 2: Find a platform

In most cases your bank will be way too expensive to use for investment purposes. It is important to realise that there is no high or low quality of the same financial product. A share in Google is a share in Google no matter where you buy it[^Of course there are types of shares, but so long as we are talking about the same asset the place you buy it has no impact].

## 3: Automate your investing

You should be automating your finances as much as possible. Not only will this buffer your emotional reactions to stock market changes, but it will cause a cost averaging effect.

Make sure to have your investment platform decuct monthly chunks of money into your investment account.

# Template: investing

The first step is to find a low cost provider of investment assets. Specifically we are looking for parties offering index funds and ETFs[^Basically these are slices of assets] of index funds.

We are looking for 2 things:

1. A world index fund
2. A world bond index fund

Based on your risk profile you can lean more towards the stock index (considered riskier, but with higher payoff) or more towards the bond index (considered less risky but with lower returns).

The rule of thumb often used is:

> Invest your age in bonds and the rest in stock.

In other words a 23 year old would invest 23% of his/her money into a bond index fund and 77% into a stock market index fund. If you have a higher tolerance for risk you can decide to alter this ratio.

Make sure to rebalance your portfolio on a yearly basis. Meaning that if your stocks to very well and are now 90% of your portfolio, move some over into bonds to get back to the original ratio. Many investment platforms offer automated services for this.

## Rules of thumb for trust

While not accurate in all cases, usually it pays off to assume:

- Mutual funds are not worth your money since they charge high fees
- Vanguard is a trustworthy player
- Don't take advice from someone who gains commissions from things they sell you
