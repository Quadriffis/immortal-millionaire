# Preface

The principles in this book are not new and they are not complex. The mechanisms that underlie them are, but you don't need to be an aerospace engineer to hop on an airplane...

After this book a great many things will become clear to you. Most likely you will realise they have been staring you in the face all this time.

Some of you will be quite upset that this material is not taught in schools. While you are right, remember that we have no control over our past, but a great deal of control over our future.
