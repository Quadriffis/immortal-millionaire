# Preface

The principles in this book are not new and they are not complex. The mechanisms that underlie them are, but you don't need to be an aerospace engineer to hop on an airplane...

After this book a great many things will become clear to you. Most likely you will realise they have been staring you in the face all this time.

Some of you will be quite upset that this material is not taught in schools. While you are right, remember that we have no control over our past, but a great deal of control over our future.

# Intention of this book

As of yet there are no immortal humans. This book will outline what you can do to extend your lifespan and healthspan within the confines of human genetics. Considering how modern technology is going, I suspect immortality is not as impossible as it sounds.

Nobody can guarantee financial success. The suggestions in this book however have been used by many individuals and organisations to amass great wealth.

# Immortality: Setting phenotype goals

This section focuses on how to optimise our bodies with the genetic code we have been given. Specifically:

1. Lifespan
2. Healthspan
3. Aesthetics

**Lifespan**

Humans historically have all died quite reliably[^crispr]. That doesn't mean though that we have no control over the length of our lives. Barring accidents and genetic defects, it is entirely reasonable to expect to exceed the average life expectation by a great deal.

**Healthspan**

What is the point of living longer if you can't enjoy it? Health span is the amount of your life where you are in good health. We can exert a surprising amount of control over our healthspan.

**Aesthetics**

While not essential, many people like looking fit & vital. Be it a well sculpted body or a smooth skin, the aesthetics of the body are to a great extent under our control as well.

# Body recomposition

This section assumes you are not yet at the body composition you desire. Maybe you have more fat than you desire, or perhaps you want more muscle mass. If you are at your preferred body composition, you are welcome to skim over this section.

## Weight is simple

The human body is a complex system, but it handles energy in accordance to the laws of thermodynamics.

> Weight change = energy intake - energy expenditure

Humans measure the energy they consume in calories[^calories]. The above means simply that:

- If you eat more energy than you expend: you gain weight
- If you eat less energy than you expend: you lose weight

There are other dimensions to body recomposition, but those are mostly psycholgical. How to tackle those we will handle later on.

For anyone that thinks their body does not conform to this principle: If this were true, your body would be breaking the laws of physics. I assure you it is not.

That said, there are people whos genetics make it easier or harder to lose weight. This is often due to their genetic food preferences[^starvation-diabetics].

The main principle for weight loss is thus simply:

> To lose weight, eat less calories than you expend. To gain weight eat more calories than you expend.

### Losing weight happens in the kitchen

Your body needs energy to stay alive. The majority of the energy you use every day is used to pump blood, keep you warm and have your brain running.

The energy used to keep you alive is called Base Metabolic Rate (BMR). It is far greater than the energy you expend doing sports.

The average BMR can be estimated with this calculation:

- Women BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kilos) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years)
- Men BMR = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kilos) + (5 x height in cm) - (6.8 x age in years)

> For a 26 year old male of 183cm weighing 78 kilos that means a BMR of 66 + (13.7*80) + (5*170) + (6.8*26) = **2188 kCal a day**.

This same male would burn about **250 kCal** for a half hour of aerobic sports.

In other words, to use the amount of calories he burns by going about his day is equivalent of 9 half hour sports sessions.

If you want to do sports, good. But don't do it to lose weight. Change your food to lose weight.

### Satiety index

Your body does not feel full based on the calories you eat. The satiety system responds to different factors, ranging from stomach fullness to lipids in your digestive system.

Some rules of thumb

| Filling | Not filling |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Protein | Fat (ish) |
| Fiber | Sugars |

Fat is an interesting one. It does trigger the satiety response, but the effect is **delayed**. Basically it fill you, but only after half an hour or so.

### Glycemic index

Your body transforms all carbohydrates into sugar. This is why all carbohydrates increase your blood sugar levels, but fats do not.

Depending on the carbohydrate type and it's packaging your blood sugar will spike to different degrees.

- Table sugar is absorbed as sugar, thus spikes your blood sugar a lot
- Pumpkin takes your body a while to break down, and then a while to break it's starches down into sugar. It doesn't spike blood sugar all that much

A high glycemic index (high blood sugar spike) is bad for weight loss. Your body is more likely to store the energy as fat, plus most high GI foods are not that filling compared to their low GI counterparts. This is a rule of thumb and not universal.

One note: the glycemic index is a carbohydrate specific measure. A more 'real world' measure is the glycemic load. Which takes into account the whole meal/food contents. It's harder to calculate on the go though.

Rules of thumb to identify high GI foods:

| Level | Guestimated GI |
| ----- | -------------- |
| High (bad) | 'White' carbohydrates like sugar, flour, bread, potato, rice, etc. |
| Medium (all right) | Sweet plants like fruits and starchy vegetables |
| Low (good) | Protein rich foods. Non/less sweet/starchy plants like leafs. |
| None (no impact) | Pure fats. Water. |

### Whitelist, not blacklist

When losing weight you want to rely on your willpower as little as possible. Every time you have to make a decision on the spot there is a chance you will make a bad decision.

Therefore, don't choose the foods you will syat away from. Rather choose the only foods you will eat.

Instead of blacklisting:

> I will not eat candy, not drink soda, drink less sweet juice, put no sugar in my coffee, etc

Go with whitelisting:

> I will only eat meats, eggs and vegetables.

It is simpler and less error prone. If you want to make your weight loss period even more fool proof, take a lesson from the Slow Carb diet and plan a set amount of meals and only eat those.

### If nothing else...

If you don't want to do a diet. The folowing rules will keep you trending in the right direction until you are ready to start:

1. Don't drink energy (kCal). No juice, soda, milk in coffee, etc.
2. Take 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking (eggs or protein shake recommended)
3. Avoid sugar



[^crispr]: This might not be true in 50 years due to genetic engineering techniques like Crisr.
[^calories]: Or more specifically kilocalories (kCal).
[^starvation-diabetics]: Fun fact. People who grew up hungry have higher risk of diabetes because their body responded by increasing food cravings. It't not magic, it's science.
