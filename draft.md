# Preface

The principles in this book are not new and they are not complex. The mechanisms that underlie them are, but you don't need to be an aerospace engineer to hop on an airplane...

After this book a great many things will become clear to you. Most likely you will realise they have been staring you in the face all this time.

Some of you will be quite upset that this material is not taught in schools. While you are right, remember that we have no control over our past, but a great deal of control over our future.

# Intention of this book

As of yet there are no immortal humans. This book will outline what you can do to extend your lifespan and healthspan within the confines of human genetics.

Nobody can guarantee financial success. The suggestions in this book however have been used by many individuals and organisations to amass great wealth.

# Immortality: Setting phenotype goals

This section focuses on how to optimise our bodies with the genetic code we have been given. Specifically:

1. Lifespan
2. Healthspan
3. Aesthetics

**Lifespan**

Humans die[^crispr]. It is what we do. That doesn't mean though that we have no control over the length of our lives. Barring accidents and genetic defects, it is entirely reasonable to expect to exceed the average life expectation by a great deal.

**Healthspan**

What is the point of living longer if you can't enjoy it? Health span is the amount of your life where you are in good health. We can exert a surprising amount of control over our healthspan.

**Aesthetics**

While not essential, many people like looking fit & vital. Be it a well sculpted body or a smooth skin, the aesthetics of the body are to a great extent under our control as well.

# Body recomposition

This section assumes you are not yet at the body composition you desire. Maybe you have more fat than you desire, or perhaps you want more muscle mass. If you are at your preferred body composition, you are welcome to skim over this section.

## Weight is simple

The human body is a complex system, but it handles energy in accordance to the laws of thermodynamics.

> Weight change = energy intake - energy expenditure

Humans measure the energy they consume in calories[^calories]. The above means simply that:

- If you eat more energy than you expend: you gain weight
- If you eat less energy than you expend: you lose weight

There are other dimensions to body recomposition, but those are mostly psychollgical. How to tackle those we will handle later on.

For anyone that thinks their body does not conform to this principle: If this were true, your body would be breaking the laws of physics. I assure you it is not.

That said, there are people whos genetics make it easier or harder to lose weight. This is often due to their genetic food preferences[^starvation-diabetics].

The main principle for weight loss is thus simply:

> To lose weight, eat less calories than you expend. To gain weight eat more calories than you expend.

The 

[^crispr]: This might not be true in 50 years due to genetic engineering techniques like Crisr.
[^calories]: Or more specifically kilocalories (kCal).
[^starvation-diabetics]: Fun fact. People who grew up hungry have higher risk of diabetes because their body responded by increasing food cravings. It't not magic, it's science.
