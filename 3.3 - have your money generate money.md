# Have your money generate money

Money is neutral. Like water it flows where it is directed. But like water it will slip through your fingers if you don't know what to do with it. The world of investing can be as confusing as being lost in the woods. But like a walk in the woods, once you have found the path and follow it, it is quite a relaxing and wonderful place.

**Principles for investing**

1. Find a low cost provider of index funds & bond index funds
2. Set your profile to your age in a bond index fund and the rest in a stock index fund
3. Set up automated investing on a monthly basis

**In this chapter**

- Why the rich get richer and how you can use that to your advantage
- How investing doesn't have to be very risky
- The power of compound interest (and danger of compound fees)
- How to actually get started
- How I almost gave up on investing until I called Vanguard

## Buy index funds & bond index funds

Investing is giving money now to get more later. Let's say I have 10 chickens that produce an egg a day each, which I can sell for €10 to my neighbours. That means I have a €10 daily income. This would equal 10*365 = €3650 a year.

You have €1000 available to invest. You offer to give me this €1000,- in return for 25% of my eggs (which would give you €2.50 every day).

> When you buy shares in a company, you are buying their future profits.

This would give you 2.50*365 = €912.50 every year. So after 2 years you would have €1825 which is a lot more that the €1000 you gave me. So why would I agree to trading your money for 25% of the profits? Well perhaps I:

1. Want to buy more chickens so I make even more money
2. I am short on cash and need money now rather than later
3. I took out a loan to buy the chickens, and want to pay it back

It's a silly example, but this is the basic mechanic of how the stock market operates.

### Individual assets are risky

Let's say we buy 5 of the 100 stocks of Acme Incorporated. This means we own 5% of the company and have a right to 5% of their profits every year.

So long as Acme does well we will gain 5/100 = 5% of their substantial profits. But what if Acme goes bankrupt? Then we lose it all...

### Index funds for stocks

Instead of buying shares in a company, we can buy shares of an index fund.

> An index fund buys the top performing companies in a region/sector.

For example the S&P 500 index fund buys shares in 500 big and reliable companies on the US market. If you buy 1 share in the S&P 500 index you in essence own a small portion of 500 companies.

> An index fund like the S&P 500 is basically like betting on the 500 companies that have proven to generate profits.

Why is this good? If one of the companies fails, the other 499 are still up and running. You spread your risk across many ventures without having to manage a complex share portfolio. Examples of an index 'market' are:

- Big US companies (S&P 500)
- Smaller companies that look like they will grow (Vanguard Global Small Cap)
- Sustainable companies (Sustainable Europe Index Fund)
- Companies in healthcare (Vanguard Health Care Index Fund)

### Bond index funds

You can also lend money to governments and corporations. These loans are called bonds You offer the bond issuer money right now, and they promise to give you back a set amount later. Common bond issuers are governments and corporations.

> A government bond allows you to give a government money, and at the end of the term (e.g. a year) they give you back more.

So what if a government can't pay you back? It has happened before (Greece, Iceland etc) and will certainly happen again. You can buffer against this by buying an index of bonds.

A share of a bond index means you are investing small amounts in many bonds at the same time. If you invest in a bond index you are at less risk of a government failing to pay their debts.

**Risk comparisons**

| Low risk / cheap | High risk / expensive |
| ---- | --- |
| Low cost index fund | High fee mutual funds |
| Stock index fund | Individual stocks |
| Bond index fund | Individual bonds |
| Low cost asset provider | Banks with high investing fees |

### Why the rich get richer

When you invest, your returns will be compounded. This year you get returns on your money, next year you get returns on the returns of last year as well! **This is way more powerful than you think.**

> €100 invested in the S&P 500 in 1928 would be €328,645.87 in 2016

One could argue that the above is an extreme example, but the concept holds true. Compound interest gives you more money the longer you have it invested.

Here are some demo calculations (assuming 4% returns):

| Monthly investment | Years | Total invested | Outcome |
| ------------------ | ----- | -------------- | ------- |
| €500 | 30 | €180,000 | €349,970 |
| €500 | 40 | €240,000 | €592,959 |
| €1000 | 30 | €360,000 | €699,940 |
| €1000 | 40 | €480,000 | €1,185,918 |

### Fees are dangerous!

Don't take your bank/broker fees for granted.

They have a huge impact. My provider charges me a yearly fee of 0.15% for example. Have a look at the impact of fees if you invest €100,000 for 30 years with a 7% return rate.

| Invested | Fee | Outcome |
| -------- | --- | ------- |
| €100,000 | 1%  | €574,349 |
| €100,000 | 2%  | €432,194 |
| €100,000 | 3%  | €324,340 |

The difference between a fee of 1% and 3% is **over €250,000**! Take your time to find a good provider that charges low fees. it will pay off massively in the long term.

## Age in a bonds, rest in stocks

The rule of thumb for risk management is to have your age in bond index funds, and the rest in stock index funds. The reason for this is that bonds tend to be more predictable with lower returns and stocks tend to fluctuate more but offer higher potential returns.

The reasoning behind this is that when you are young you have more tolerance for fluctuations in your wealth portfolio. Historically we know recessions balance themselves out in the long run. Problem being that is you are 89 years old, you don't want to wait 10 years for the stock market to recover.

For that reason this rule of thumb can be used to make your portfolio more predictable as you grow older.

## Set up automated investing

Humans are not good at managing emotions when it comes to money. Since the stock market is bound to go up and down, you need to make sure you buffer against making bad decisions.

### Decide on a strategy and stick to it

If for example there is a downturn in the financial market, you should not allow yourself to even consider selling any of your investments. Not if you set up a good diversified strategy.

If you want to talk to a financial advisor, be sure to talk to a fiduciary, not just any financial advisor. Anyone can call themselves a financial advisor and often they get commission on the financial products they sell you. They are basically sales people who do not have your best interests at heart. A fiduciary on the other hand is by law required to be neutral (e.g. to not get comission).

Personally I have created a 'Personal Investment Policy' with a number of rules like:

- 50% or more of my wealth should be in index funds (bonds/stocks based on age)
- 50% or less is allowed to be in revenue generating investments (e.g. real estate rental)
- 10% or less in speculative assets (stocks I manually pick)
- I will only consider investments with a 6% or above return
- And so on

The above is not a template for you, but an example of the conclusions I reached based on my personal risk tolerance and research.

### Find a platform

In most cases your bank will be way too expensive to use for investment purposes. It is important to realise that there is no high or low quality of the same financial product. A share in Google is a share in Google no matter where you buy it[^Of course there are types of shares, but so long as we are talking about the same asset the place you buy it has no impact].

### Automate your investing

You should be automating your finances as much as possible. Not only will this buffer your emotional reactions to stock market changes, but it will cause a cost averaging effect.

Make sure to have your investment platform deduct monthly chunks of money into your investment account.

### Balancing your risk

The first step is to find a low cost provider of investment assets. Specifically we are looking for parties offering index funds and ETFs (which are basically slices of assets) of index funds.

We are looking for 2 things:

1. A world index fund
2. A world bond index fund

Based on your risk profile you can lean more towards the stock index (considered riskier, but with higher payoff) or more towards the bond index (considered less risky but with lower returns).

The rule of thumb often used is:

> Invest your age in bonds and the rest in stock.

In other words a 23 year old would invest 23% of his/her money into a bond index fund and 77% into a stock market index fund. If you have a higher tolerance for risk you can decide to alter this ratio.

Make sure to rebalance your portfolio on a yearly basis. Meaning that if your stocks do very well and are now 90% of your portfolio, move some over into bonds to get back to the original ratio. Many investment platforms offer automated services for this.

### Rules of thumb for trust

While not accurate in all cases, usually it pays off to assume:

- Mutual funds are not worth your money since they charge high fees
- Vanguard is a trustworthy player
- Don't take advice from someone who gains commissions from things they sell you

## How I found out

I had just started university when the occupy movement gained traction. As I mentioned in the previous chapters, my years of university taught me a lot about money. The occupy movement popularised all sorts of things like:

- The 1%
- The rich get richer
- Unfair banking

I understood very little about the underlying systems at the time. As I gradually learned more, I think I came to some conclusions that the occupy movement didn't intend.

The 1% richest in the world earn over €30,250 a year. Something even a school teacher can make in my country. I understood that the movement meant to point at difference within the US, but it lost some wind for me in the grand perspective of the world. I did learn that all hapiness and health outcomes of a people are linked to income disparity. On all accounts I'm happy to live in the Netherlands.

The rich get richer took me a while to internalise. It expresses that having money somehow gets you more money. It made no sense to me, until I saw a graph of compound interest. Suddenly it made sense, based on basic math we can say that the more you have the more and faster you gain money. This felt like the best news ever! Who cares about the billionaires and aristocrats, you are telling me that as my life goes on I will progressively get more and more money? The race gets easier as I go along? Sign me up.

The unfairness of the banking and investing world did strike me as a fundamental disservice to humanity. As I found out about wonderful tools like low cost index funds, I also found out most major Dutch banks charge a stupid and unfair amount of fees for you to buy financial products with them. I then discovered that this is a great time to be alive, there are multiple new players shaking up the industry with low cost and high quality solutions (looking at you Brand New Day and Degiro).

All in all the occupy movement firmly taught me one thing:

> I need to learn the rules of the game called "money"

In the following years I started looking at the game of money in more detail. Soon enough I found that things were not as bad as they seemed. There was a stark contrast between two camps, the people who:

- Achieved what I wanted to achieve had simple advice
- Wanted to sell me their financial products said investing is complicated

After reading a number of books I was sold on stock and bond index funds. I had read about a company called vanguard that offered products structured in a fair way and was determined to get started with them. I did what I thought made sense:  I called my bank to ask about the posibility to buy vanguard ETFs.

The result was depressing. I was treated like an annoyance. As a twentysomething year old wanting to invest I had a few thousand euros available, which was a lot of money for me. The phone call went along the lines of this:

- Bank: "Hello this is Bank"
- Me: "Hello, this is your customer Mentor. I would like to invest in vanguard ETFs but can't seem to find the way to do this on your website."
- Bank: "We offer investment services through another department, how much are you wanting to invest?"
- Me: "I am just starting out and am looking to build up a solid portfolio for the coming 40 years."
- Bank: "Sigh. Well sir, I think for a person your age this is not the right avenue to explore. We like to deal with larger clients who let us manage their wealth."
- Me: "I get that, and I intend to become one of those people. What are your fees?"
- Bank: "That really depends"
- Me: "Sir, I just want to know what your transaction and management fees are."
- Bank: "Sigh. That question is not so straightforward. There are many types of fees that differ per product and client."
- Me: "Can you give me an example?"
- Bank: Goes on to explain ridiculous fees.
- Me: "Thank you for your time sir"
- Bank: Hangs up.

I was so utterly disappointed. Was this the kind of person I would have to deal with if I wanted to grow my wealth? Was the banking sector filled with dead-eyed snobbish 'advisors' that would not give me the light of day until I was a millionaire?

The day was still young, so I resolved to give the vanguard corporation itself a call. Turns out they have an Amsterdam office. I expected to be talking to a receptionist who would connect me to an even worse banker. After all, this was the company behind the assets my bank would trade for me.

- Vanguard: "Hello this is X from vanguard"
- Me: "Hello, my name is Mentor. I am looking to start a portfolio and have read many recommendations for vanguard."
- Vanguard: "That is good to hear! It's always exciting when a person decides to start investing"
- Me: Confused. Is that enthusiasm? "So can I open an account with you directly?"
- Vanguard: "Ah sir, I'm afraid we don't do dealings with consumers directly in the Netherlands. We only do that in the US."
- Me: "Ok, thank you for your time"
- Vanguard: "But I'm happy to talk you through the types of products we have available in the Netherlands and their pros and cons if you would like?"
- Me: Astonished face. "Yes please"
- Vanguard: Takes a full half hour to talk me through all the options, answers all my questions in detail.
- Me: "So what company can I buy your products at?"
- Vanguard: "I'm afraid vanguard doesn't recommend specific brokers"
- Me: "Any personal advice?"
- Vanguard: "Sure thing. I prefer working with broker Binck, but have also heard good things about Brand New Day which was founded by some founders of Binck after they left. I have not heard good things about most traditional banks."
- Me: "Thank you very much for taking the time to help."
- Vanguard: "My pleasure, call back anytime."

I was astonished. This person just took 45 minutes out of his day to help a young guy who obviously is not a millionaire. That same day I called Binck and Brand New Day. Both took a great deal of time answering my questions. They gave me advice on diversification, tax structuring, lifetime cycles and all sorts of things I hadn't thought about. And neither of them tried to pressure me into buying anything.

That day I learned that there are kind and helpful people who are trying to do good in the banking industry. Sure, there are arrogant numbskulls who I imagine live up to the stereotypes the occupy movement put forth. But when I looked around, I found people doing their best to subvert the system to benefit regular people with regular incomes.

The helpful new companies did everything the advice I had gotten in the past years told me to do:

- Use low cost index funds that reinvest dividends
- Have low transaction fees
- Automate the whole investment portfolio

The months following I set up an automated portfolio and let my broker automatically deduct monet from my account on a monthly basis. Of course those transactions go into my budget as "present for future Mentor".
