## Hardware vs software

What we experience as our mind can be viewed from two angles:

- The hardware (brain)
- The software (mental processes)

They are very much linked, but very much separate. Consider the following:

- How good can a person with good math software (a mathmatician) perform math when the hardware is debilitated (he is massively drunk)?
- How well can an olimpic athlete (good hardware) solve linear algebra without any math education (no software)?

In order to perform at your best it is important to tackle both elements of mental performance. That also means that you need to pick your battles:

- No amount of supplements will replace education & discipline
- No amount of genius can replace physical needs

Of course there is a balance between these two. A genius who eats only donuts will still outperform a health conscious gardener. But the genius in question is not using the full potential at his disposal, it's like driving with the hand break on.

Take both the software and the hardware seriously. Optimise both, but do not exclusively focus on one or the other.

## Treat sleep as work

Sleep is not wasted time, quite the contrary. It is what enables optimum performance in the waking hours. A mildly sleep deprived person has similar cognitive impairments to someone who has drank 2 glasses of alcohol (BAC of 0.05%, based on 80kg/18-lb person)[^See Moderate sleep deprivation produces impairments in cognitive and motor performance equivalent to legally prescribed levels of alcohol intoxication: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1739867/]. Similarly to drinking, many people will deny feeling impaired when impaired.

A traditionally sleep deprived demographic is doctors in training, who tend to insist they are performing just fine. Switching from a traditional work schedule to a more sleep friendly schedule however decreased the mistakes they made by 36%[^See The Phantom Menace of Sleep-Deprived Doctors: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/magazine/the-phantom-menace-of-sleep-deprived-doctors.html]. In other words being treated by a tired person makes it significantly more likely mistakes will be made in your treatment.

Sleep is not a passive process. It is a very active collection of processes. We are not entirely sure how it works, but we know now that it has very concrete effects. Some of my favorites:

| Activity | Beneficial for |
| -------- | ------- |
| Clears metabolic byproducts like reactive oxygen species from the brain | Protecting brain health |
| Store energy in the brain as glycogen | Assuring mental energy & improved mood during the day |
| Explicit memory development (slow wave sleep) | Long term storage of facts |
| Procedural memory development (REM sleep) | Improving automatic skills like driving or playing the piano |
| Growth hormone secretion | Support body growth and recovery |

Sleep deprivation on the other hand causes:

- Cognitive impairment (concentration, mood)
- Weakened immunity
- Obesity risk due to hormonal changes
- Cardiovascular disease risk increase
- Stunted growth hormon levels (growth, recovery)

There is no set sleep need that applies to all humans. Average sleep durations fluctuate between 7 and 8.5 hours per day. For good sleep I personally have had good results with the following principles:

- **Calibrate the amount of sleep you need** - take 2-6 weeks where you plan to be in bed for over 10 hours at the same time. Preferably set an alarm clock only after 10 hours of sleep and wake up naturally. In the beginning you will spend a lot of time in bed, but as the weeks progress you will stabilise around a time. Pro tip: make sure to have light exposure in the morning, or your body will have troble figuring out when the day begins.
- **Have a set time at which you get up** - respect your biological circadian rhythm. Neglecting your physiological sleep/wake cycle, or shifting it during the week has been described as 'social jet lag', which has detrimental effects on health and prevents you from feeling rested[^See the book *Internal Time: Chronotypes, Social Jet Lag, and Why You're So Tired* by Roenneberg].
- **Set your cycle using (sun)light** - the body clock is set based on light. Increase your light exposure in the morning, and decrease it at night. Preferably sit in a brightly lit location during the day (near a window for example) and decrease blue light exposure at night. I recommend turning down the brightness of your screens and installing an app like Flux that filters blue light out of your screen later in the day. I also enjoy having a n alarm clock that simulates sunrise (Philips wakeup light).
- **Went to bed late? Nap.** - if you went to bed late, don't sleep in but rather have a nap in the middle of the day. This prevents you from breaking your rhythm, but allows you to compensate for the lost sleep. Try to nap earlier on in the day (before 5pm) but well after you have gotten up and have exposed yourself to bright (sun)light.
- **Have a bedtime routine** - in an ideal situation you set an alarm at night that reminds you to start winding down. No more screens, low light, no mentally stimulating input. I personally have a short stretch routine, meditate and read fiction.
- **Make your bedroom a sleepy place** - expecially at night have low light and low (but not freezing) temperatures. During sleep time assure a constant temperature and no light whatsoever. Ideally condition your mind to view the bed as a place of sleep and nothing else. Do this by only using the bed for sex, sleep and pre-sleep routines like reading fiction. Personally I use ear plugs and a sleep mask, often even if I don't need them, purely as a conditioned response for my mind.
- **Take caffeine and alcohol early rather than late** - both interfere with sleep quality by supressing specific sleep processes and/or cycles (even if you fall asleep fine). Caffeine has a half-life in the blood of 3-7 hours in healthy adults, and a clearance time of 8-24 hours. Preferably use it only in the morning. Alcohol supresses REM sleep so is preferably avoided.
