## Hardware vs software

What we experience as our mind can be viewed from two angles:

- The hardware (brain)
- The software (mental processes)

They are very much linked, but very much separate. Consider the following:

- How good can a person with good math software (a mathmatician) perform math when the hardware is debilitated (he is massively drunk)?
- How well can an olimpic athlete (good hardware) solve linear algebra without any math education (no software)?

In order to perform at your best it is important to tackle both elements of mental performance. That also means that you need to pick your battles:

- No amount of supplements will replace education & discipline
- No amount of genius can replace physical needs

Of course there is a balance between these two. A genius who eats only donuts will still outperform a health conscious gardener. But the genius in question is not using the full potential at his disposal, it's like driving with the hand break on.

Take both the software and the hardware seriously. Optimise both, but do not exclusively focus on one or the other.

## Treat sleep as work

Sleep is not wasted time, quite the contrary. It is what enables optimum performance in the waking hours. A mildly sleep deprived person has similar cognitive impairments to someone who has drank 2 glasses of alcohol (BAC of 0.05%, based on 80kg/18-lb person)[^See Moderate sleep deprivation produces impairments in cognitive and motor performance equivalent to legally prescribed levels of alcohol intoxication: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1739867/]. Similarly to drinking, many people will deny feeling impaired when impaired.

A traditionally sleep deprived demographic is doctors in training, who tend to insist they are performing just fine. Switching from a traditional work schedule to a more sleep friendly schedule however decreased the mistakes they made by 36%[^See The Phantom Menace of Sleep-Deprived Doctors: http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/magazine/the-phantom-menace-of-sleep-deprived-doctors.html]. In other words being treated by a tired person makes it significantly more likely mistakes will be made in your treatment.

Sleep is not a passive process. It is a very active collection of processes. We are not entirely sure how it works, but we know now that it has very concrete effects. Some of my favorites:

| Activity | Beneficial for |
| -------- | ------- |
| Clears metabolic byproducts like reactive oxygen species from the brain | Protecting brain health |
| Store energy in the brain as glycogen | Assuring mental energy & improved mood during the day |
| Explicit memory development (slow wave sleep) | Long term storage of facts |
| Procedural memory development (REM sleep) | Improving automatic skills like driving or playing the piano |
| Growth hormone secretion | Support body growth and recovery |

Sleep deprivation on the other hand causes:

- Cognitive impairment (concentration, mood)
- Weakened immunity
- Obesity risk due to hormonal changes
- Cardiovascular disease risk increase
- Stunted growth hormon levels (growth, recovery)

There is no set sleep need that applies to all humans. Average sleep durations fluctuate between 7 and 8.5 hours per day. For good sleep I personally have had good results with the following principles:

- **Calibrate the amount of sleep you need** - take 2-6 weeks where you plan to be in bed for over 10 hours at the same time. Preferably set an alarm clock only after 10 hours of sleep and wake up naturally. In the beginning you will spend a lot of time in bed, but as the weeks progress you will stabilise around a time. Pro tip: make sure to have light exposure in the morning, or your body will have trouble figuring out when the day begins.
- **Have a set time at which you get up** - respect your biological circadian rhythm. Neglecting your physiological sleep/wake cycle, or shifting it during the week has been described as 'social jet lag', which has detrimental effects on health and prevents you from feeling rested[^See the book \*Internal Time: Chronotypes, Social Jet Lag, and Why You're So Tired\* by Roenneberg].
- **Set your cycle using (sun)light** - the body clock is set based on light. Increase your light exposure in the morning, and decrease it at night. Preferably sit in a brightly lit location during the day (near a window for example) and decrease blue light exposure at night. I recommend turning down the brightness of your screens and installing an app like Flux that filters blue light out of your screen later in the day. I also enjoy having a n alarm clock that simulates sunrise (Philips wakeup light).
- **Went to bed late? Nap.** - if you went to bed late, don't sleep in but rather have a nap in the middle of the day. This prevents you from breaking your rhythm, but allows you to compensate for the lost sleep. Try to nap earlier on in the day (before 5pm) but well after you have gotten up and have exposed yourself to bright (sun)light.
- **Have a bedtime routine** - in an ideal situation you set an alarm at night that reminds you to start winding down. No more screens, low light, no mentally stimulating input. I personally have a short stretch routine, meditate and read fiction.
- **Make your bedroom sleep conducive** - expecially at night have low light and low (but not freezing) temperatures. During sleep time assure a constant temperature and no light whatsoever. Ideally condition your mind to view the bed as a place of sleep and nothing else. Do this by only using the bed for sex, sleep and pre-sleep routines like reading fiction. Personally I use ear plugs and a sleep mask, often even if I don't need them, purely as a conditioned response for my mind.
- **Take caffeine and alcohol early rather than late** - both interfere with sleep quality by supressing specific sleep processes and/or cycles (even if you fall asleep fine). Caffeine has a half-life in the blood of 3-7 hours in healthy adults, and a clearance time of 8-24 hours. Preferably use it only in the morning. Alcohol supresses REM sleep so is preferably avoided.

## Control blood sugar levels

Low blood sugar is known to make people grumpy and lethargic. But why do many people report low energy after meals? Shouldn't blood sugar be high?

Your cognition depends on your brain. Your brain depends on energy. No energy means no performance. Energy can reach the brain in two main ways:

1. Glucose
2. Ketones

If you have not heard of the ketogenic diet and generally eat more than once every 24 hours, you will basically rely on glucose in most situations. Glucose is the type of sugar your body uses for energy all over. In general all carbohydrates are eventually converted to glucose during digestion. Glucose is kept within a certain bandwidth.

- Very high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) can cause permanent damage to your body
- Very low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) deprives your body from energy

Having optimal levels of glucose does not mean you should eat every 30 minutes to keep your body supplied with energy. Your body is very capable of regulating your blood sugar if you give it the food it was evolved to consume.

There are three components to blood sugar levels:

- Input / increase through food
- Storage / decrease through insulin
- Usage / decrease through usage

The key here is that insulin is released to store high blood sugar levels. If you cause a sharp rise in blood sugar your body will respond with a drastic insulin response potentially causing your glucose levels to drop below what they were before.

To keep your blood sugar within productive levels, the concept of glycemic index (GI) and load (GL) are very important. They are at length discussed on the weight loss chapter. For now it is enough to know that:

- High GI causes a blood sugar spike. In general the sweeter and less fiber rich a food the worse it is.
- Low GI foods are fat, protein and fiber rich.  

You can look up GI lists online very easily. Consider the following scenarios as examples of the effect of GI on cognition:

| Scenario | Effect | Cognitive performance |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| Large soda (high GI, high quantity) while working behind a computer (low energy) | Short lived higher blood glucose followed by an insulin induced crash | Short increase, long reduction |
| Tab of glucose (high GI, low quantity) while in the middle of a heavy workout | Small glucose boost, offset by high glucose usage by musles[^And high glucose absorption due to GLUT-4 migration in muscle membranes] | Neutral / positive depending on initial levels |
| Low GI breakfast | Gradual and sustained blood glucose support | No decline the entire morning[^See "A low glycaemic index breakfast cereal preferentially prevents children's cognitive performance from declining throughout the morning": https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666306006398] |
| No breakfast | Waking up with low blood glucose, no external stimulation. | Lower perforance, unless adapted. |

Note that the last entry seems a bit vague. The fact of the matter is that different people are better or worse at self-regulating glucose levels. This is a combination of genetics and conditioning. I personally fast every day, usually until 2pm or later. This intermittent fasting approach (see longevity chapter) has conditioned my body to more effectively regulate blood glucose and rely more on ketones.

 As a general rule keep the following principles in mind:

| Principle | Why |
| --------- | --- |
| Eat low GI foods | Prevents a high insulin response. |
| Don't drink calories | Sodas, fruit juices etc usually have high sugar content and expecially when consumed alone cause a blood sugar spike. If you are having one, keep the quantity in check and consume it slowly. |
| Eat protein, fat and fiber rich foods | These generally have lower GI ratings. |
| Consume high GI in low quantities | Your body can handle even pure sugar if you don't consume too much. A little pick me up is not per se bad, but consume low quantities. Ideally choose a low GI alternative. |

Guidelines for meals:

- Reduce the glycemic load by eating low GI foods and combining higher GI foods with low GI foods and fiber
- Reduce size to mitigate insulin response, the more you eat the more your body needs to work to handle the blood sugar response (of course mitigated by GI/GL)
- Reduce the speed at which you eat so your body doesn't have to handle everything at once
- Do some mild exercise before and after eating. Ideally also 60-90 minutes after the meal. By doing this you mitigate the need for glucose since muscle movement decreases the need for insulin and increases insulin sensitivity.

## Use caffeine in concert with l-theanine

Caffeine is one of the most used and abused substances in the world. The problem is that many people do not use it in a productive way to increase their performance but rather use it to cover up deficiencies in the management of sleep and blood sugar.

Caffeine:

- Does not provide energy, it blocks the effect of adenosine in the brain. In essence is prevents feeling tired, at least as a result of adenosine levels.
- In low dosages has healthy effects but in excess causes a host of issues
- In many people causes anxiety and nervousness to varying degrees
- Causes lower levels of energy that before using it within a 2 hour window

To use caffeine effectively:

- Fix your sleep
- Fix your blood sugar
- Use it in the morning only
- Combine it with l-theanine

L-theanine is an amino acid found in green tea. The dosage of theanine depends very much on the tea type and quality. An average green tea bag will not contain much, whereas a high grade matcha tea will contain far more.

Before going into the details, please note that:

- Caffeine, coffeine and theine are the same substance
- Theanine is not thymine or tiamine
- L-theanine can be metabolised by humans, d-theanine can't
- When you read theanine without a prefix l-theanine is implied

Theanine is an amino acid that can cross the blood brain barrier and thus (like caffeine) affects the brain directly. Some effects of theanine can be described as the opposite of caffeine:

- A calming effect and stress reduction
- Increased alpha waves in the brain (focus)
- No crash after usage

Some effects are similar to what is experienced with caffeine:

- Better memory
- Improved attention
- Increased learning ability
- No increase in drowsiness

In short one might say that where caffeine causes a restless and short lived perceived energy spike, were theanine offers a calm longer term focus. In combination caffeine lifts the calmer energy levels of theanine up, and theanine keeps caffeine from running out of control.

Combining the two has proven very effective for many people seeking to improve their cognitive performance with easily accessible materials. For effective usage:

- Experiment with 2:1 to 4:1 theanine:caffine ratio
- Do not use this as frequently as coffee, I don't do this more than once a day (the effect is long lasting)

If you have the habit of drinking coffee all day, consider switching to tea or decaf. You do not want to overload your system.

A note on safety: this combination is generally lauded as the safest cognitive enhancer on the market. The ingredients are easy to find and the side effects are considered to be due to the caffeine usage rather than the combination.
