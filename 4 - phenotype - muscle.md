# Muscle gain vs strength

Before reading this section keep in mind the following things:

1. Most people don't need most muscle, just less fat
2. Strength and muscle size are not the same

Before deciding on any course of action, be sure what your goals are. If you want to look in shape, usually losing weight through diet is the best course of action. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do exercise, but rather that you shouldn't rely on exercise alone to look more fit.

# Gaining muscle: 2 variables

To increase your lean muscle mass there are many very effective techniques. They all rely on two basic variables:

1. Trigger muscle growth
2. Supply relevant nutrients

Any training programme that supplies both of the above will yield results. There is no one 'good' way of working out for muscle gain. There are however many bad ways.

## Triggering muscle growth

Triggering muscle growth is simple in principle. You want to send your muscles the signal that they are not sufficient. Exhausting your muscles by doing heavy things basically gives the signal of:

> I had to fight/run for my survival, and these muscles were barely suficient.

By stretching your limits in exercise you tell your body to activate the set of genes that causes the growth of muscles. Some people have easy to trigger genes, meaning a little exercise shows great result. Others need a heavier stimulus.

### Choosing your workout

What matters in choosing your workout is that you train your muscles in a way that exhausts them. Particularly we're not looking for cardio exhaustion (like stationary bikes) but rather muscle exhaustion (resistance/weight training).

A good workout:

- Trains muscle groups
- Exhausts muscles
- Is safe for long term usage

In general it pays off to do exercises that train multiple muscles at the same time. An example would be targetting deadlifts rather than a lower-back only machine. Not only does it mean you target more muscles at once, but it also keeps the muscle growth in balance with the muscles in it's functional vicinity.

For muscle growth an important factor is exhaustion. The more you work you muscles to the 'I can not do this any longer' point the more you're triggering the signal to grow. There is some nuance in this as overtraining is counterproductive. This mostly pertains workout frequency rather than workout intensity though.

Safely is of prime importance. If you do an exercise irresponsibly you will in the best case prevent yourself from working out for a while, and in the worst case cause permanent injury.

To compile your workout the easiest is usually to ask a personal trainer at your gym to help you out. Often you will as you go along learn more and more about fitness and begin to tweak your workout as you go along. There are some recommendations to get you started in the template section.

## Supply relevant nutrients

The second factor is feeding your body the building blocks it needs to grow muscle. In simple terms: proteins. There is a lot of nuance there to do with bioavailability and amino acid makeup, but in essence it comes down to those two questions.
