# Muscle gain vs strength

Before reading this section keep in mind the following things:

1. Most people don't need most muscle, just less fat
2. Strength and muscle size are not the same

Before deciding on any course of action, be sure what your goals are. If you want to look in shape, usually losing weight through diet is the best course of action. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do exercise, but rather that you shouldn't rely on exercise alone to look more fit.

# Gaining muscle: 2 variables

To increase your lean muscle mass there are many very effective techniques. They all rely on two basic variables:

1. Trigger muscle growth
2. Supply relevant nutrients

Any training programme that supplies both of the above will yield results. There is no one 'good' way of working out for muscle gain. There are however many bad ways.

## Triggering muscle growth

Triggering muscle growth is simple in principle. You want to send your muscles the signal that they are not sufficient. Exhausting your muscles by doing heavy things basically gives the signal of:

> I had to fight/run for my survival, and these muscles were barely suficient.

By stretching your limits in exercise you tell your body to activate the set of genes that causes the growth of muscles. Some people have easy to trigger genes, meaning a little exercise shows great result. Others need a heavier stimulus.

### Choosing your workout

What matters in choosing your workout is that you train your muscles in a way that exhausts them. Particularly we're not looking for cardio exhaustion (like stationary bikes) but rather muscle exhaustion (resistance/weight training).

A good workout:

- Trains muscle groups
- Exhausts muscles
- Is safe for long term usage

In general it pays off to do exercises that train multiple muscles at the same time. An example would be targetting deadlifts rather than a lower-back only machine. Not only does it mean you target more muscles at once, but it also keeps the muscle growth in balance with the muscles in it's functional vicinity.

For muscle growth an important factor is exhaustion. The more you work you muscles to the 'I can not do this any longer' point the more you're triggering the signal to grow. There is some nuance in this as overtraining is counterproductive. This mostly pertains workout frequency rather than workout intensity though.

Safely is of prime importance. If you do an exercise irresponsibly you will in the best case prevent yourself from working out for a while, and in the worst case cause permanent injury.

To compile your workout the easiest is usually to ask a personal trainer at your gym to help you out. Often you will as you go along learn more and more about fitness and begin to tweak your workout as you go along. There are some recommendations to get you started in the template section.

## Supply relevant nutrients

The second factor is feeding your body the building blocks it needs to grow muscle. In simple terms: proteins. There is a lot of nuance there to do with bioavailability and amino acid makeup, but in essence it comes down to those two questions.

Muscles are primarily composed muscle fibers, which are protein structures. When your body is triggered to generate more muscle my exercise, it also needs to get nutrients to work with.

There are two classifications of protein intake that matter when building muscle:

1. Timed protein consumption (less important)
2. Total protein consumption (more important)

Body builders tend to fixate on eating protein before, durng and after a workout. The idea is that exercise causes the body to become catabolic (breaking down muscle) and it needs protein to turn anabolic (building muscle) again.

> From research on exercising while fasting we know that there is little to no loss of muscle when eating nothing for hours before, during and after a workout.

Additionally many try to eat meals every 2-3 hours to 'supply a constant stream of nutrients'. This again stems from the faulty idea that not supplying protein will make the body break down muscle.

> Eating protein every 3 hours is only marginally better than only once or twice a day.

If you want to be a full-time body builder, go ahead and eat meals every few others. If you are a regular human gaining muscle, don't worry too much about meal timing. Rules of thumb:

- Eating some protein after a workout is good, but not doing it is no issue
- Eating protein every few hours only is marginally better for muscle growth
- Having an adequate total protein intake really matters

### Protein quality

Not all protein is created equal. Specifically what matters is the ratio of amino acids and their bioavailability of the source. The currently used method to rate proteins is the *Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score* or DIAAS. It taked into account:

- The amino acid needs of a human
- The degree to which a protein is absorbed by humans

You can look up DIAAS tables online. In general animal source proteins (dairy, meat, eggs) are of the highest biological quality. This is why WHEY protein (dairy source) is very popular in body building.

This doesn't mean that plant proteins don't help muscle growth. It does mean that your body doesn't absorb them as well and might need a very diverse groups of protein sources.

### The (untrue) protein absorbtion limit

There is a lot of untrue common sense out there. In the fitness world it is often referred to as 'broscience'. While it usually doesn't cause any explicit harm, it often tells people to do silly things.

There is no limit to the amount of protein the body can consume in one meal, so no it's not 40 grams. This mantra stems from a misinterpretation of a study that found that 20-40 grams of protein was the most optimal per-meal consumption amount to stimulate muscle growth.

Later studies have found that the body is perfectly capable of absorbing far above 40 grams in one meal. An extreme example is that people who eat one meal a day absorb the protein from their huge meals just fine.

# Strength is neurological

While muscle size is one factor, it is not the only variable in muscle strength. The physical structure of the muscle determines theoretical output, like how many seconds it takes for a car to accelerate to a certain speed.

What matters in practice is how strong the neurological signal to exert force is. There is a safety limit on the percentage of strength a muscle can theoretically and practically produce.

> Electrocution or tetanus for example can cause the muscles to spasm violently enough to break bones.

When training for strength you are in essense helping your body understand how much strength is safe to use.

## Greasing the groove

A popular approach to strength rather than muscle size is *greasing the groove* as described by Pavel Tsatsouline. This protocol consists of three tennets:

1. High load (lots of effort)
2. Low consecutive repetitions (no exhaustion)
3. Regular repetitions throughout the day

The **high load** refers to the need to use muscles close to their strength limit. It's not about exhausting them but rather about making one repetition of a difficult move.

The **low repetition** element is linked to the above. If you can do 10 repetitions of a movement, it is not hard enough for this protocol.

The **regular repetitions** refer to doing the high-load movements often throughout the day. Where muscle growth asks you to do 20 heavy movements after each other, this protocol wants you to do single repetition sessions every hour or even half an hour.

The protocol as written by Pavel focuses on two body-weight exercises:

- One handed (+one legged) push up
- Pistol squat

These are highly technical moves that stimulate a large number of muscle groups. The one handed/legged push up for example stimulates everything from triceps to pectorals to core and even the upper leg.

The principles of this protocol however translate to many other exercises. Just keep in mind that this protocol is more dangerous with respect to injuries since you are training with high muscle load. Technique is even more important than with regular resistance training.

# Motivation and consistency

As with losing weight things like acountability are very important. But while weight loss is an all-day endeavor, exercise is often more about routine and consistency.

It is highly recommended to read the motivation and accountability section in the weigth loss chapter. It still pays off to use accountability measures like betting pools or anti-charities. For strength and muscle gain however routine is of even more importance.

For hypertrophy/size training it is advisable to have certain days or times of day where you exercise. Personally I like going to the gym (and consecutively sauna) in the morning. Whatever works for you, schedule it. Put it in your calendar. Preferably have a friend or personal trainer to hold you accountable.

For strength training set triggers throughout the day. Try to make your home and place of work conducive to this. This might work better for some professions than others. Having a pull up bar in the door to your office is for example a great way to do single-rep slow pull ups throughout the day. Likewise having space in your office to do a quick one handed pushup will contribute to your consistency.
