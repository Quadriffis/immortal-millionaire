# Homeostasis: the body's balance

The body has a number of control mechanisms that function as feedback loops. This system is called homeostasis. An example is how the human liver produces less cholesterol if the diet contains a lot of it.

Homeostatis often works through generalised mechanisms. For example environmental stressors will trigger defense mechanisms. Exposure to heat through saunas increase the production of heat schock proteins that defend the body from heat damage.

Interestingly the mechanisms sometimes are more general than one would expect. Fasting for example also increases the creation of heat schock proteins.

In this section we are looking to trigger stressors in a controlled way, and thus activating defense mechanisms that defend our body from actually harmful situations.
