# Homeostasis: the body's balance

The body has a number of control mechanisms that function as feedback loops. This system is called homeostasis. An example is how the human liver produces less cholesterol if the diet contains a lot of it.

Homeostatis often works through generalised mechanisms. For example environmental stressors will trigger defense mechanisms. Exposure to heat through saunas increase the production of heat schock proteins that defend the body from heat damage.

Interestingly the mechanisms sometimes are more general than one would expect. Fasting for example also increases the creation of heat schock proteins.

In this section we are looking to trigger stressors in a controlled way, and thus activating defense mechanisms that defend our body from actually harmful situations.

Note that the diets described here are **not** intended for weight loss per se.

## Fasting & feasting

The human body has two interesting states:

- Build stuff
- Destroy/repair broken stuff

The building cycle is important since it is the time when we build new cells, proteins and so on.

The destroy/repair state is important since broken cells and components can result in nasty things like cancer.

The caveat here is that these states can't optimally function at the same time. When the build state is dominant the repair state is less active and vica versa.

Interestingly *eating stimulates building* and *fasting stimulates repair*. In other words, feeding your body will trigger it to use those nutrients. Not feeding your body will allow your body to repair itself on a cellular level.

- Fasting triggers repair
- Feasting triggers growth

One issue our society has is that we don't give the body enough time to enter the fasting restorative mode. We eat pretty much the whole time we're awake.

There are a number of fasting 'levels' to be aware of:

| Fasting type | Effect |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Juice fast | This is *not* fasting. It'll rest your intestines a bit but has little metabolic effect. |
| No calorie fast | Nothing with energy (caloric) content. Coffee/tea is fine, but only without sugar and milk. This is good for fasting, but might reduce some of the benefits related to elevated oxidative stress. |
| Water fast | The most effective fast usually. Harder to use in regular life. |
| Full fast | No water, no food. While the most pure fast the benefits compared to a water fast are not that much. |

### The benefits of fasting

The average human body can live for 3 days without water and 3 weeks without food. On a bioligical level not eating for a full day is really not that extreme. Many have argued that in the human hunter/gather days is way quite common to eat a lot one day (caught an animal) and nothing the next (caught no animal).

Fasting and intermittent fasting have shown a number of interesting effects on both animals and humans. Note that this is very recent research so it's all still very experimental.

So far there are strong indications for:

- Reduce risk for certain cancers
- Reduce risk of mental disease
- Increase lifespan

There are a lot of cellular and metabolic effects that you can read about online[^fasting-writeup].

While any extreme lifestyle change should be discussed with a medical professional, there are for most people no health risks involved in fasting.

### Ketosis: metabolic plan B

The body usually relies on a glycolytic pathway for energy. In other words, we usually run on carbohydrates. The body mostly supplies energy to the muscle and brain through blood sugar.

For many people this is the reason they feel low when they have not eaten (low blood sugar) or when they have just eated (blood sugar spike followed by insulin spike).

There is an alternative energy mechanism called ketosis. In this state the body does not break down carbohydrates but rather fats. Instead of using blood sugar for primary energy delvery, the body uses ketones.

Being in ketosis has a host of health benefits. The list is very similar to fasting. Indeed a great deal of the benefits of fasting stem from the fast that fasting helps trigger ketosis.

Entering a ketotic state is done by depriving the body of carbohydtates. A ketogenic diet is often 80%+ fats. Longer fasts result in ketosis, and thus supply benefits similar to the ketogenic diet.

## Intermittent fasting

It takes the body a while to enter recovery mode once you start fasting. When you eat something during a fasted state the countdown timer starts anew.

One aproach to implementing fasting into your life is intermittent fasting. Popular approaches include:

*The 16/8 approach* where you only eat for 8 consecutive hours a day and fast the rest of the day. For example only eating between 16:00 and 24:00. When the window is doesn't matter (caveats later on), what matters is that for 16 hours you do not eat or drink anything with caloric content. Most fasters do still consume coffee and tea without milk and sugar.

*The 5/2 approach* in which you eat regularly for 5 days a week but eat very little or nothing 2 days a week. While health benefits can be found when 2 days are very low on energy consumption, the body will only fully benefit if there is a period of actual fasting.

*Alternate day fasting* is exactly what it sounds like. You eat for one day, and do not eat the next.

## Fast mimicking diet

Longer fasts result in more dramatic health benefits. They are however also harder to do, and are not practical for certain target groups. It is for example known that fasting reduces some side effects of chemotherapy. Having a cancer patient fast is often not responsible or doable though.

Dr Valter Longo pioneered a multi-day fasting approach that still allows for some nutrition, but is very selective in what one is allowed to eat. The idea is to keep the effects of fasting, while not fasting entirely.

While the official fast mimicking diet is distributed as a commercial product, the tennets of this approach are:

- Low caloric intake (sub 1000 kCal)
- Low protein & carbohydrate (under 10% & 50%)
- High fat (over 40%)
- No antioxidants (coffee, green/black tea etc)

Self experimenters online also suggest using only high medium-chain-triglyceride oil like coconut oil as an energy source. Supplementation with salt is also advised since the body loses salt when glycogen stores are depleted suring fasting.

## Heat and cold exposure

This is not about food, but rather temperature stressors. The body gains a lot of benefit from controlled extreme heat exposure (sauna) and controlled extreme cold exposure (ice baths).

Particularly saunas are in many countries relatively easy to implement as habits through gyms that offer them.

Benefits of saunas include:

- Improved cardiovascular function
- Increased blood flow
- Increases red blood cell count
- Metabolic improvements (oxygen transport, heat schock proteins)
- Enhanced endurance
- Improved muscle growth (paired with exercise)
- Growth hormone release (downstream effects on mTOR and FOXO pathways)
- Increased insulin sensitivity
- Increased life span (in animals)
- Neurogenesis[^neurogenesis] in the brain (through BDNF[^bdnf])

As for frequency, research so far seems to indicate that more is better. Going twice a week beats once, going 5 times beats 4, etc.
