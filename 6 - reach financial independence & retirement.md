# Reach financial independence / retirement (Fi/Re)

1. Calculate your desired yearly income
	- Create an inventory of your non-optional expenses & add them together
	- Make 3 tiers: survival, comfort & thriving
2. Multiply by 25
3. Budget & invest (next chapters)

## Tools

The fi/re movement is using the 21st century tools available to become financially independent. There are many approaches including the lean[^Spending as little as you can so you can stop working. For example getting a little house on a beach in a cheap country] and fat[^'Living the life'. Mansions, boats and everything in between] views.

**Useful numbers**

- You need 25 times your yearly desired income invested
- The above assumes a historically conservative withdrawal rate of 4% + inflation

## Why and how this works

Our goal is to create a perpetual money growing tree.

The goal of your money tree is to generate money for you. There are 3 steps to building your tree:

1. Calculating the size
2. Growing the tree
3. Eating the fruits forever

For most people retiring on a money tree is feasible, especially if you start early.

## Calculating the size

There are three money amounts we will calculate what you need to reach:

1. Survive - meet your basic needs
2. Thrive - allow you to spend on fun
3. Freedom - let you live your perfect lifestyle

For each of these three we need to come to a specific number.

> **Note:** The below examples will have a lot of holes, they are meant to illustrate the process, not to be 100% accurate.

### Survival: not having to work

Your basic needs come down to food, shelter and obligations. Calculate your monthly cost and multiply by 12 to calculate what yearly income you need.

Things to keep in mind here:

- Rent
- Food
- Insurance
- Non optional costs

**Do not include fun** in here. The idea of your survival number is that you will not go into debt if you stop working. The survival level is not about retirement as such, having this amount will grant you certain perks like:

- No stress over not making rent
- Freedom to quit your job and take months finding your next
- All your income is now available for fun

Make this category as bare bones as possible.

> **Note on lean fi/re.** There are a class of people that calculate their financial goals not on where they live now, but on where they could live. For example living in Thailand is infinitely cheaper than New York City. I suggest calculating this amount based on where you *currently* live. You can always move.

Example for me in Amsterdam:

| Expense | Monthly size in € |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl gas/water/electricity) | 780 |
| Food | 200 [^I prefer 400, but can live on 200] |
| Cellphone plan | 15 [^My current one is higher, but at current rates this serves my needs] |
| Healthcare insurance | 100 [^Mandatory by law in the Netherlands] |
| **Total** | €1095 |

€1095 times 12 months equals €13,140. This is the after-tax income I need to survive.

### Thriving: include fun

The second amount we calculate will include the spending desires you have. In this level we include regular stuff you currently do, but not yet your crazy dreams like holiday homes, private islands and space travel.

An example:

| Expense | Average expenditure per month in € |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Massages | 200 |
| Foodie foods | 200 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Better healthcare | 50 [^If you are from the US this sounds strange, but maximum healthcare is about 150-200 in the Netherlands including dental etc.] |
| Optional insurances [^Property, travel, etc] | 50 |
| Travel | 200 [^€2400 a year is worth 5-10 trips within Europe.] |
| **Total** | **735** |

Survival (1095) plus fun (735) equals €1830. This equals a yearly (12 months) amount of €21,960.

Note that this number will vary greatly per person and location. Many big city Americans will marvel at the low rent/healthcare/food costs while rural Italians will scoff at these exorbitant numbers.

There are no wrong answers. This is is about how you personally want to live yout life.

### Freedom: the dreams

This category is not about spending as much money as possible but rather about fulfilling your dreams. Note that this might take some research.

Many people think they want to buy a yacht to sail the mediteranian seas. But in the words of secondhand yacht salespeople: *the only days you will be happy about your yacht is the day you buy it and the day you sell it*. For the vast majority of people the cost of maintenance, storage etc is a nightmare.

Think instead about how you can have the *experience* you want. For example:

- Buying a yacht is expensive, renting it for a week is cheaper. Are you really going to spend 6 months a year using it?
- Same for private jets. Chartering a jet often beats owning one.
- House on the beach? If you use it only a month a year perhaps budgeting for a high end airbnb suits you better.
- And so on.

An example calculation:

| Dream | Yearly cost |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Spending winter in Spain | 6000[^3 months of €2000 gets you a sweet time in Spain. Lower cost places like Thailand will be even more extreme.] |
| Weekly massages | 5200[^100 times 52 weeks] |
| City trip every month | 4500[^500 per trip times 9 months (since we are in Spain in winter)] |
| Fun shopping | 12000[^1000 a month seems good to me, maybe you like it higher or lower] |
| **Total** | **€27,700** |

This (€27,700) adds to the previous survival & fun (€21,960) to: €49,660

## Calculating the size

There is a well established rule in investing that a balanced portfolio can over time safely support a 4% withdrawal rate[^See the 1994 paper "Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data", http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/Bengen1.pdf].

There are many news outlets that will gladly proclaim that the 4% number is wrong because the study is from 1994 where interest rates were higher. These sensationalist non-experts lack long term historical perspective. In fact the original researcher recently crunched the numbers based on recent market data and in his own words:

> The "4% rule" is actually the "4.5% rule"- I modified it some years ago on the basis of new research. The 4.5% is the percentage you could "safely" withdraw from a tax-advantaged portfolio (like an IRA, Roth IRA, or 401(k)) the first year of retirement, with the expectation you would live for 30 years in retirement. After the first year, you "throw away" the 4.5% rule and just increase the dollar amount of your withdrawals each year by the prior year's inflation rate. [^See this wonderful 'Ask me Anything' on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6vazih/im_bill_bengen_and_i_first_proposed_the_4_safe/]

Of course there are posibilities that a black swan event occurs and everything we thought we knew about money goes out the window. This chance is however quite low and leaves us with no strategy to plan.

**We will act based on the best information available to us.** Which is to assume a 4% withdrawal rate.

Based on the calculations of the previous paragraphs:

| Yearly income | Assumed withdrawal | Needed money tree |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| €13,140 | 4% | €328,500 |
| €21,960 | 4% | €549,000 |
| €49,660 | 4% | €1,241,500 |

A little math trick: to get your money tree size based on 4% take your yearly income and multiple it by 25. (For the math people, this is because 1/.04 = 25)

### Money forever?

But won't your money run out as some point? Not if the 4% rule leeps going. Take the (simplified) example of €13,140. If your money has an average return of 4%, then every year the tree grows by €328,500 * 4% = €13,140. Which means that when you take €13,140 a year, you are always left with the original €328,500.

But can this really work? Well **the best information we have says yes**.

As Bill Bengen notes[^His specific comment can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6vazih/im_bill_bengen_and_i_first_proposed_the_4_safe/dlz1l6r/]:

>  I find that the state of the "economy" had little bearing on safe withdrawal rates. Two things count: if you encounter a major bear market early in retirement, and/or if you experience high inflation during retirement.

But what about the major financial crashes we've has the past years?

>  So far, I have not seen any indication that the 4.5% rule will be violated. Both the 2000 and 2007 retirees, who experienced big bear markets early in retirement, appear to be doing OK with 4.5%.

His exact words on withdrawals forever:

> If you plan to live forever, 4% should do it.

How do we make sure we get a 4% return while current[^As of 2017] interest rates are under 1%? We'll get to that in the investing chapter.
