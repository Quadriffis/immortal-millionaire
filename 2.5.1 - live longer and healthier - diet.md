# Live longer and healthier: diet

![Teacup with Herbs]( ./assets/2.5.1.jpg )

Our experience of life is always through the lens of the body. Keeping the vessel we use to experience reality in shape is the ultimate investment. Like any machine our body was optimised to be used in certain ways, by respecting those we can increase the odds of living long and well.

## Take care of the basics first

Let's say your neighbour drives a car with a broken windshield. The came car has a squeaky door handle on the passenger side. Which do you think he should fix first?

In the example it's obviously the windshield. But when it comes to heath people are for some reason predisposed to reaching for supplements or 'superfoods' before fixing their basic lifestyle. Your body is not going to thank you for taking an experimental supplement if you are obese or out of shape.

Basic principles to stick to:

- Avoid well documented health risks like smoking, refined sugars, processed foods, trans fats and hydrogenated fats
- Make sure you are not overweight and are consuming no more calories than you need.
- Eat vegetables. A 2014 study basically found that more is better for your risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality (the study measured up to 7 portions a day, a portion is 80 grams)[^See [Fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality: analysis of Health Survey for England data](http://jech.bmj.com/content/68/9/856)]
- Have an exercise routine that is more than nothing. See the exercise sections below for details, but in essence do some kind of sport.

## Longo's longevity diet

Lifespan appears to be a function of genetics and lifestyle. While we have no control over genetics (yet, looking at you crispr-cas[^A gene editing technique that could be used to fix genetic defects. See the [Crispr-cas wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)]) we do have control over our lifestyle. One of the major impacts is what we eat.

Remember that food is for humans what fuel is for cars. You would expect no good things from throwing diesel into a regular petrol/gasoline car. It is important for us to figure out what our body thrives on, and then makes sure it receives that.

It is near impossible to study to do a double-blind placebo controlled trial on humans for longevity diets. The study would likely be unethical and take at least one human lifetime. What we can do is:

1. Epidemiological studies (how long do people who smoke live? Can we draw conclusions?)
2. Animal studies (if it works on a worm, could it work on a human?)
3. Centenarian studies (how did the oldest humans live?)
4. Clinical studies (what can we learn about healthy living from treating diabetics?)

From the above we can identify strategies that are likely to increase our odds of a long and healthy life. According to the research compilation of doctor Valter Longo in his book [The Longevity Diet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35697130-the-longevity-diet) the general recommendations from the above sources seems to be:

- **Go loosely vegan/pescatarian** - prefer fish high in omega 3 and vitamin b12 but low in mercury. Examples include salmon, anchovies, sardines, cod, sea bream, trout, clams, shrimp.
- **Below the age of 65 keep protein intake low** - defined as 0.31-0.36 grams per pound of bodyweight, or the metric equivalent of 0.68-0.80 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. E.g. an 80kg/176lb person should consume around 60 grams of protein a day.
- **Above the age of 65 increase protein intake** - in increase of 10-20%. Centenarian studies find that the lower levels of growth related hormones need to be compensated for with slightly higher protein intake.
- **Consume complex carbohydrates** - from sources like vegetables, beans and legumes. Glycemic index and load are your guide here. A portion of lentils (150g) has a glycemic load of 5, whereas a portion of white rice (150g) has a glycemic load of 27. See [this list by Harvard University](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods).
- **Optimise the intake of healthy fats** - from sources like nuts and olive oil. Avoid trans fats, hydrogenated fats and saturated fats (in that order of priority).
- **Practice time-restricted eating** - see the hormesis section on fasting. Centenarians appear to eat 1-2 meals a day plus snacks within a span of 12 hours. Aim to eat nothing 3-4 hours before sleep.
- **Eat a diet high in a variety of nutrients** - most of the above will guide you to such a diet, but remember to make a conscious effort to eat a variety of foods. You may consider looking at the food patterns of your ancestors (within the confines of the above recommendations) to lightly optimise for your particular genes[^Fun fact, evolution is slow but visible. Historically heavy dairy consumers like the Netherlands have low incidence of lactose intolerance. Genetic pools like native Americans are quite reliably lactose intolerant or allergic.].

The above assumes you took care of the basics like obesity and deficiencies.

## Commentary on Longo's longevity diet

There are some caveats I'd like to point out that he above recommendations will be beneficial, but are most likely incomplete. Particularly, recommending low saturated fat intake regardless of source and recommending low protein intake regardless of source.

The fact is that the studies leading to the above conclusions are not double blind placebo controlled studies. That leads to potentially infinite confounding factors. For example, looking at a country like the United States (where a lot of research is done) you will see many secondary relationships like:

- People who eat a lot of saturated fat often do so from low quality food, they also tend to do less exercise and participate in a host of unhealthy behaviours
- Similarly a high protein diet can easily be an indicator of a diet rich in fast food, and thus likely high in glycemic index

What it comes down to is that the conclusions drawn from epidemiological studies are **unlikely to do harm and potentially do a lot of good**.

### Saturated fat

The recommendation to avoid saturated fats is one I expect to be altered in the coming years of research. The reason for this is that diets rich in saturated fats (think US diet) are often rich in other problematic ingredients like trans fats, sugars and low vegetable ingestion. Additionally not all saturated fats are the same with regards to health benefit or risk.

An early indication for this can be found in a paper that compared cardiovascular disease (CVD), all cause mortality (ACM) for different sources of saturated fat (SFA) consumption[^See [Dietary fat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in a population at high risk of cardiovascular disease](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283723416_Dietary_fat_intake_and_risk_of_cardiovascular_disease_and_all-cause_mortality_in_a_population_at_high_risk_of_cardiovascular_disease)]:

- Saturated fat intake showed an increased risk cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality
- Mono and poly unsaturated fats showed a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality

This seems to confirm commonly cited recommendations. However, saturated fat intake:

- From fish and nuts decreased cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality
- From processed meats increased cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality
- From dairy showed increases for cardiovascular disease, except for the highest consumption category where it was decreased
- From dairy showed decreased all cause mortality for the second lowest consumption category, but high risk for high consumers

In other words saturated fat is bad unless it comes from fish or nuts, or if you get it through low dairy consumption.

The above paints a confusing picture. What I mean to show with it is that things are more complicated than saturated vs unsaturated fats. The coming years of research will probably find that specific fats are beneficial or harmful as opposed to putting all saturated and unsaturated fats on the same pile.

### Protein intake

Similarly to saturated fat there are studies finding complexities in protein intake. For example a study on over half a million people showed[^See [Meat Intake and Mortality, A Prospective Study of Over Half a Million People](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414881)]:

- Red meat increased all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer
- Processed meat increased all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer
- White meat **decreased** all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer (the effect was more pronounced in men)

Similarly fish (a high protein food) consumption has been shown reliably to decrease cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality. A study on a diabetic nurse population found a dose-dependent relationship between fish, where the highest benefit was shown in those who consumed fish more than 5 times per week[^See [Fish and Long-Chain Ï‰-3 Fatty Acid Intake and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease and Total Mortality in Diabetic Women](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/107/14/1852)]. A meta analysis including 222,364 people found a similar 'more is better' relation for fish, at least for cardiovascular disease[^ See [Accumulated Evidence on Fish Consumption and Coronary Heart Disease Mortality](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/109/22/2705)]. These studies are not perfect, but do point to a more complex system than 'less protein is better'. Similar results were found based on WHO and FAO data[^See [Fish Consumption and Mortality from All Causes, Ischemic Heart
Disease, and Stroke: An Ecological Study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743598904728)].

In general studies most studies find higher mortality for populations that consume high amounts of protein[^See [Low carbohydrateâ€“high protein diet and mortality in a cohort of Swedish women](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01774.x/full), [Low carbohydrate-high protein diet and incidence of cardiovascular diseases in Swedish women: prospective cohort study](http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e4026), [Low-carbohydrateâ€“high-protein diet and long-term survival in a general population cohort](https://www.nature.com/articles/1602557)]. Most studies point out though that these results seem to be primarily to animal protein consumption. Based on the aforementioned studies one might even hypothesise that if these studies would have split white meat, red meat, fish and vegetable protein sources the results would have been far more nuanced.

## Hybrid longevity diet

There are valid arguments to be made for a Longo style longevity diet, but in my opinion it lacks nuance. The recommendations will probably result in health benefits for most people who choose to adhere to all of the recommendations. Based on my own reading of the underlying research and other studies I follow a hybrid longevity diet that is likely to change as new information becomes available.

**Food intake**

- **Fats for energy** - I take the majority of my calories in the form of fats and most of my food volume as plants. The research I have read so far seems to support strategies of relying on fats or complex carbohydrates to maintain a low glycemic load diet. I have noticed that by the numbers I rely on fats for energy. A gigantic bowl of salad (half a kilo) with a shot glass of olive oil (50 grams) will supply about 150 kcal from the salad and 440 from the oil. Likewise a kilo of tomato will supply 180 kcal, and a large handful of nuts (100 grams) 600-700 kcal.
- **Fats by specific type** - the saturated/unsaturated divide may not be helpful in separating the health effects on humans. So far research is conflicting. A controversial study for example found that replacing saturated fats with a specific unsaturated one resulted in a _higher risk_ mortality[^See [Use of dietary linoleic acid for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and death: evaluation of recovered data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study and updated meta-analysis](http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707)]. Combined with the studies above I try to eat oils with a documented positive effect.
	- **Olive oil** has been reasonably well documented to have positive health effects. It's major fatty acid content is oleic acid which seems to be beneficial. It is my oil of choice for non-cooking uses. I would like to stress that I recommend high quality oil (you should be able to drink it straight) since low quality oils are often fake and far less tasty.
	- **Coconut oil** is my oil of choice of cooking oil due to it's stability, high smoking point and shelf life. It is also high in medium chain triglycerides making it loved under those who aim for ketosis (see fasting section).
	- **Vegetable oils in general** I prefer to avoid based on the conflicting evidence of both the study in the first bullet and studies finding indications that certain vegetable oils can increase heart disease and cancer incidence[^See [Diet and disease--the Israeli paradox: possible dangers of a high omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid diet.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8960090) and [New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-50)]. That includes margarine products, especially for heated cooking. I specifically avoid oil high in the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid (not to be confused with alpha-linolenic acid which is an omega-3) as studies seem to indicate it has a particularly negative effect[^See [New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-50)]. This excludes oils with a good research track record like olive.
	- **Animal fats** such as meat and dairy are traditionally thought of as bad due to their saturated fat content. Since saturated fats in recent research have not proven to be reliable predictors of health risks (when not combined with other unhealthy foods), I don't worry about them to much. I have shifted my consumption of meat away from beef due to the environmental impact but am nutritionally not against high quality unprocessed meat, that means yes to a good steak but no to fast food. Fats from fish are robustly documented to have a positive health impact so I have as much of those as I want
- **Protein quality vs quantity** - doctor Longo suggests a low intake of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. I have taken his research as a reason to keep an eye on my protein intake, but don't obsess over the numbers. Like the studies in the Longo diet commentary suggest there are differences between protein sources and the studies he bases those conclusions on are all flawed in that they are not double blind placebo controlled studies. Still, choosing to eat more fish and vegetable proteins is unlikely to have a negative health effect, so I have a lot of fish and nuts.
- **Carbohydrates based on glycemic load** - I am not against carbohydrates as a rule but choose them based on the strain they put on my body. That means high glycemic load foods like fruit juices are a no, but vegetables, beans and legumes are fine. Based on those parameters I refrain from traditional staples like potatoes, rice and grain products (e.g. pasta, bread).
- **Vegetables** are a low risk and high gain proposition. A variety of them will supply a host of nutrients against a low glycemic load and calorie intake. When it comes to preferences I use glycemic load and index as an indicator. I exclude high-starch plants like potato from my consumption but consume high quantifies of greens.
- **Only fermented dairy** meaning no milk. The correlations so far indicate higher all-cause mortality and cardiovascular risks for milk consumption but decreased risks for fermented dairy like yoghurt[^See [Milk intake and risk of mortality and fractures in women and men](https://www.bmj.com/content/349/bmj.g6015)].
- **No documented health risks** - some things are well documented to be negative: refined sugars, trans fats, hydrogenated fats.

**Food timing**

- **Time restricted eating** - I have been intermittent fasting for years and greatly enjoy it. Doctor Longo adds the extra dimension of having your eating window during the day due to keeping in sync with the circadian rhythm. I currently have a 8 hour eating window starting at noon.
- **Periodic multi-day fasting** - research on multi-day fasts and the fast mimicking diet is pretty incredible. I currently do a 5 day fast every 3 months. For the details on this approach see the fasting section later in this chapter.

## Getting started

How you approach any sort of dietary intervention depends on your self-knowledge. Ask yourself whether you are a cold-turkey kind of person, or whether gradual change suits you more. Take into account that this is an endeavour in structural change.

> A single behaviour permanently changed will have more impact that an intense temporary change

Personally I have a propensity for radical change. If you are like me in that regard, I recommend you do the following:

- Document your rules, meaning what you will and will not consume and when
- Make a set of default meals and a shopping list
- Remove all non-desired foods from your vicinity

Writing down your rules as well as having them visually around (stick it on the fridge) will help you internalise them. Make very specific decision rules. When I started my rules were:

- I will read the label of everything I eat and refuse anything with sugar, glucose, sucrose, fructose, dextrose and maltodextrin on the label
- I will eat no (products of) grains, potato, rice or equivalents (e.g. quinoa, bulgur etc)

To increase the chance you adhere to your rules, make a list of easy to make meals that you will enjoy. Include snacks. I personally found that chomping on cucumber, tomatoes and chicory (Belgian endive, common in the Netherlands) make me a happy person. Likewise there are a number of default salads and soups I turn to when in doubt about what to eat.

If you are not a "all or nothing" minded individual, first off congratulations on being more even tempered than I. You will most likely benefit from a more gradual approach. What works great for many people is an elimination based approach:

1. Eliminate one thing
2. Get used to it
3. Repeat

By cutting out single things you don't have to deal with intensely upending your usual habits. It is in fact likely that this paced approach will lead to structural changes that will benefit your health. I recommend doing the following things in the order presented:

1. Stop drinking sugars
2. Stop eating added sugars
3. Stop eating low GI/GL carbohydrates like white bread/rice/potato/pasta
4. Increase your intake of olive oil and fish
5. Start time restricted eating

Those five things will radically change your health habits. If you want to optimise further from that point, look at the principles in this book and institute the things that suit your life and goals.

## How university turned me into a lab rat

My bachelors degree turned out to be a double blessing. Not only did I get to explore human biology through curriculum, but many classes required me to write research papers on a topic of my choice.

It took some convincing in some cases, but in many cases I could use these papers to dive deeper into subjects that interested me. One pivotal moment was a metabolism paper I wrote called "Resveratrol bioavailability and Action". It was by no means a masterpiece, but triggered the interesting notion that the human body has built in mechanisms that increase lifespan.

You see, resveratrol was at the time considered a promising life extension compound. It's a powerful antioxidant that influences gene expression. It seemed to:

- Protect against cancer
- Activate the SIRT1 gene group who's equivalent extends life in other organisms
- Buffer the effects of high cholesterol

It turns out that resveratrol supplementation in humans is not all that effective since our liver metabolises it very quickly.

Nonetheless my interest was piqued. The SIRT1 gene group spoke to my imagination. Specifically the idea that the human body is capable of extending it's lifespan if we take the right steps in our lifestyle.

This lead me to an interest into epigenetics, the study of how the environment influences gene expression. One important thing to understand here is that genes are not a blueprint for the human body in the way that pop-culture sometimes presents it.

Human genes are an if-this-then-that system. If a certain stimulus is given human cells are programmed to respond in a certain way. For example (simplified):

- Sunlight > activate melanin genes > darker skin
- Vitamin d > influences hundreds of genes > changes in bone, mood, immune system etc

I felt like I had discovered something magical. After hearing my entire life that genes are a static blueprint that make my body what it is, I now knew that my genes are just a large repository of potential outcomes.

While resveratrol seemed to be a bust, my interest into longevity was piqued. Specifically, many studies seemed to talk about insulin when talking about longevity. Even resveratrol had a close link to insulin and related measures. A later paper I wrote called "The role of insulin in fasting metabolism and gene expression" was my first touchpoint with what I would later learn to call intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.

During the researching of this paper I found some things I at the time called counterintuitive, for example:

- Fasting increases growth hormone levels
- The body is perfectly capable of producing glucose without eating carbohydrates (or anything for that matter)
- Fasting periodically has similar benefits to limiting food consumption
- Fasting is good for the brain

In that particular paper I learned the basics of FoxO and mTor functions and how they relate to fasting and longevity.

As much as I enjoyed the rabbit hole of academic research, I'm a practically inclined person. After handing in this paper I started a regime of 16 hours of fasting a day. I expected to find it very hard to do, but actually thrived on this approach.

Since I had formulated some strict rules for myself as to what I do and do not eat, keeping myself fed throughout the day was a bit of a challenge. Not having to worry about food for the majority of the day was incredibly freeing! Not only that, but my mental and physical energy levels increased during the times I didn't eat.

Throughout my university years I started more and more to research longevity and unconventional lifestyles to optimise the body. After the first two years of study I had converted myself to:

- Intermittent fasting
- Sauna sessions 5+ times a week
- Low carb leaning to ketogenic diet

I also continued to experiment with:

- Cognitive enhancement supplements & practices
- Alternative sleep cycles

Through the years of experimentation I learned to separate fact from fiction. Since then words like intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet have become pop culture. It's the first time I've been a hipster, I did it before it was cool. While my post-university years were when I refined a lot of my protocols and theories, the basis for all of it has been my years in the academic world.

My experiments do not turn into dogma. As new information becomes available I adapt. My goal is to make the best decisions based on the information I have at the time. My most recent change was to incorporate a larger portion of complex carbohydrates into my diet based on the longevity studies of dr Longo.

I continue to read, experiment and refine my lifestyle. Some people say it sounds exhausting, I say it sounds exciting.
