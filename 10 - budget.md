# Ingredient one: the budget

Let's get one thing straight: budgetting is about freedom.

I love budgetting. It gives a feeling of control and freedom. After my monthly budget session (30 minutes) I have zero anxiety over money.

The goal of a budget is not to make you feel like you are limiting yourself. It is about being in a situation where you can spend money without the anxiety of wondering whether you can afford something.

A good budget:

| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl gas/water/electriity) | 780 |
| Food | 400 |
| Cellphone plan | 30 |
| Healthcare insurance | 110 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Property insurances[^Dutch people insure pretty much everything] | 25 |
| **Total** | 1380 |

The above expenses are things I was 100% sure of they would be charged to my account.

## Step 2: Variable expenses

The above are expenses that are out of my control to the point that I can't just decide to not buy them for a month. Besides these there were a number of things that were optional, but quite reliably expenses. Go through your bank statements and find patterns.

| Expense | Average expenditure per month in € |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Massages | 200 |
| Wine | 50 |
| Espressos | 20 |

Besides those there were
