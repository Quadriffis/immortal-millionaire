# Ingredient one: the budget

Let's get one thing straight: budgetting is about freedom.

I love budgetting. It gives a feeling of control and freedom. After my monthly budget session (30 minutes) I have zero anxiety over money.

The goal of a budget is not to make you feel like you are limiting yourself. It is about being in a situation where you can spend money without the anxiety of wondering whether you can afford something.

A good budget:

- Plans for expenses (rent, food)
- Incorporates fun (a 'guilt free' budget)
- Makes you feel in control

## Step 1: certain expenses

Begin by making a list of expenses you know you reliably make on a monthly basis. For many people this includes things like rent, food and transport.

It is of paramount importance to know exactly which financial responsibilities you have. Below is an example of my budget when I lived in Amsterdam[^I rounded off the numbers].

| Expense | Monthly size in € |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl gas/water/electriity) | 780 |
| Food | 400 |
| Cellphone plan | 30 |
| Healthcare insurance | 110 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Property insurances[^Dutch people insure pretty much everything] | 25 |
| **Total** | 1380 |

The above expenses are things I was 100% sure of they would be charged to my account.

## Step 2: Variable expenses

The above are expenses that are out of my control to the point that I can't just decide to not buy them for a month. Besides these there were a number of things that were optional, but quite reliably expenses. Go through your bank statements and find patterns.

| Expense | Average expenditure per month in € |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Massages | 200 |
| Espressos | 20 |
| 'Splurge foods' | 100 |
| Total | **320** |

The above expenses are reliable enough to calculate into your budget in a flexible manner. For me personally the above translated into a monthly budget category 'wellness' of 200 and a 'guilt free spending' of 200 to account for other variable expenses.

## Step 3: The structure

How you categorise your expenses is up to you, what is important however is that only a very small amount of unforeseen expenses are allowed to be without a category.

For me personally the budget looked as follows:

| Bu dgetCategory | Monthly size in € |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl gas/water/electriity) | 780 |
| Food | 400 |
| Cellphone plan | 30 |
| Healthcare insurance | 110 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Property insurances[^Dutch people insure pretty much everything] | 25 |
| Wellness | 200 |
| Guilt free | 120 |

Based on this table I know that I need €1380 every month to survive and another €320 to do the things I love (massages, coffee).

The above table means that:

- Every month I knew I had (or didn't have) enough money
- I knew how much money to save to have 6 months of living expenses saved

## Step 4: The YNAB way

I am a very big fan of a budgeting software called You Need A Budget (YNAB for short). They approach budgeting with 4 rules:

1. Give Every Dollar [ or Euro ] A Job
2. Embrace Your True Expenses
3. Roll With The Punches
4. Age Your Money

I love their approach. They have a great page dedicated to their suggested system[^YNAB Method, https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/].

Brief explatations (copied from their webpage):

1. *As soon as you get money, you’ll decide what it needs to do—whatever is most important to you. Then, instead of deciding to buy something based on your mood, or the big (or small?) pile of money in your checking account, you’ll decide based on a rock-solid plan.*
2. *Take those large, less-frequent expenses (that usually send you into a financial tailspin) and break them into manageable, monthly “bills.”  Good-bye, Financial Crisis Roller Coaster! You just won a free ticket on the Financial Peace Express!*
3. *When you overspend in a budget category, just adjust. No guilt necessary. If you plan to take the kids to the beach but it’s pouring down rain, do you still go? Of course not! Circumstances change and plans change with them. Your budget is no different. If you overspend in one category, free up money from another category and move along. Remember, you’re the boss!*
4. *With the help of the other three rules, you’ll be more purposeful about your spending, consistently spend less than you earn, and be more than prepared for the future. Eventually, you’ll be able to cover May’s rent with dollars from April. Your money will be at least 30 days old and you’ll wonder how you ever lived without the Four Rules.*

I highly suggest getting a free trial[^Use my referral link and get a free month: http://bit.ly/free-month-ynab] with them and give it a shot. It has been a significantly positive effect on my financial life.
