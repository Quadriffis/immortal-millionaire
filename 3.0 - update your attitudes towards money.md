## Money can never be evil

Money is a resource. It has no brain, it has no emotions, it has no intentions. Like water it simply flows where directed based on cause and effect. Examine arguments that people use to call money evil and substitute money for water. Ask yourself:

- Is water evil because people drown?
- Is water evil because people are dying of thirst?
- Is water evil because it flows only in certain places?

Even though people die because of water for varying reasons, without it life as we know it could not exist. The same is true for money. Don't get me wrong, terrible things are done in the name of money. But these are terrible acts by humans. Terrible acts are done in equal measure for religion, respect, food and passion.

I could make a list of the benefits of money, but I think you know them. You are reading this paragraph on a medium that would not have been created without a monetary system. You have food tonight because money allowed your supermarket to offer a remarkable array of products. Fantastic things like healthcare and the internet would never have arisen without a monetary value system.

There are plenty issues in the world related to money and the financial system. But those are not due to money, those are due to bad incentives that make people act against the interest of others. A powerful force, be it money or water, needs to be constrained for the safety of those around it. Like a river has riverbanks against a flood, so too much a financial system protect the people using it. How that needs to be done is a different discussion all together. But it is a discussion about managing human actions, not about managing money.

## Money is not a goal

Seeing money as a goal is a thoughtless claim. I have yet to meet a person who expressed a desire for money itself. Humans don't care about money but rather what they think they can get with it:

- Physical objects (car, phone, house)
- Social status (respect, admiration)
- Self-image (confidence, belonging)
- Experiences (travel, events)
- And so on

You wouldn't say your goal in life is having lots of water. Your goal is never dying of thirst. Likewise your goal is never money, but rather what this resource can facilitate in your life.

One of the keys to a healthy relationship with money is examining why you are striving to earn it. It all comes down to the previous paragraph: money is just a resource. In the end many people have similar goals:

- Not to have to work unless they want to
- To travel an see the world
- To feel secure about their survival (food/shelter etc)
- To have a purpose in life

In all of these things money is not the only factor. In fact you often needs far less money than you would expect to achieve the above, which is what we'll cover in the coming chapters.

## Having money doesn't make you good or bad

There are people with money who do good things, and there are people with money who do bad things. The money however is not the reason for either of their behaviour. In the majority of cases people who are generous stay generous when they have money, and people who were frugal remain frugal.

For some reason there is a common belief that people with money are nefarious. Perhaps the source of that belief is the assumption that the only way to make money is to disadvantage others. While those cases certainly exist, as a rule money is gained in return for something people want. In many cases people trade their money for something they desire out of their free will.

Don't get me wrong, there are terrible situations where people are bled dry of their money and have no other viable choice than to pay. Like those that occur in the US healthcare system or predatory loans.

But in the majority of cases people spend money on things that make their life a lot better. Things that used to be incredibly challenging for a human to get. Like food, housing, education, healthcare and technology. In order for people to be able to buy those things, there need to be people offering them. By extension for people to spend money on things, there need to be people receiving them.

That means that so long as we like having things to spend money on, the people offering them to us will receive money for them and grow wealthy. So long as those people do not abuse their position, there is nothing wrong with that (or them).

## The rich have an unfair advantage
