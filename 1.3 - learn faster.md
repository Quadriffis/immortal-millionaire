# Learn faster

Learning is about understanding. It's not about memorising the latin name of oranges. It is about looking at an orange and knowing why the white sunlight turns orange on it's skin. It is about knowing that oranges are alive and processing millions of chemical reactions while they lie there on the fruit bowl. Learning is the skill of seeing how everything is connected, and what you can do with that.

**Principles for faster learning**

- Think in systems rather than facts
- True understanding can be explained to a 5 year old
- Approach content with specific questions
- Record your learnings in a referance format

## Think in systems rather than facts

Imagine I show you a large pile of bricks and tell you to memorise the location of all the bricks. You then close your eyes and I take one away. Are you confident you can tell me what brick is missing?

Now imagine that we take those bricks and build a little house out of them. If I remove a brick now, it would be trivial to find out which. In fact you could not only see which brick is missing, but you could make a very accurate guess at what kind of brick should fill up the empty spot.

Learning should work the same. Instead of jumbled facts brute forced into your mind build trees and networks of knowledge. It's common to find this kind of reasoning in the sciences and engineering, but it can be applied everywhere.

Let's say we are baking a cake. The ingredient list says:

- 200 grams of butter
- 200 grams of sugar
- 200 grams of flour
- 4 eggs

It turns out we only have 3 eggs in the house! A fact thinker might come to the conclusion we can't make the cake, or have to change the recipe. A systems thinker on the other hand will say that a recipe is about ratios. Meaning we can create the cake according to the recipe by subtracting 25% from the butter, sugar and flour. One less egg is 1/4 less, which is 25%.

Cooking is a very simple example, but this concept becomes incredibly powerful as you apply it more. It will also allow you to make connections across what are usually considered isolated areas of knowledge.

For example:

- Ideas and religions compete for humans the same way virusses compete for hosts
- The internet works similar to the human nervous system
- Lightening follows the path of least resistance in a similar pattern as tree branches

The more you connect things, the easier it becomes to understand new things.
