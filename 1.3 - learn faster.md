# Learn faster

Learning is about understanding. It's not about memorising the latin name of oranges. It is about looking at an orange and knowing why the white sunlight turns orange on it's skin. It is about knowing that oranges are alive and processing millions of chemical reactions while they lie there on the fruit bowl. Learning is the skill of seeing how everything is connected, and what you can do with that.

## Think in systems rather than facts

Imagine I show you a large pile of bricks and tell you to memorise the location of all the bricks. You then close your eyes and I take one away. Are you confident you can tell me what brick is missing?

Now imagine that we take those bricks and build a little house out of them. If I remove a brick now, it would be trivial to find out which. In fact you could not only see which brick is missing, but you could make a very accurate guess at what kind of brick should fill up the empty spot.

Learning should work the same. Instead of jumbled facts brute forced into your mind build trees and networks of knowledge. It's common to find this kind of reasoning in the sciences and engineering, but it can be applied everywhere.

Let's say we are baking a cake. The ingredient list says:

- 200 grams of butter
- 200 grams of sugar
- 200 grams of flour
- 4 eggs

It turns out we only have 3 eggs in the house! A fact thinker might come to the conclusion we can't make the cake, or have to change the recipe. A systems thinker on the other hand will say that a recipe is about ratios. Meaning we can create the cake according to the recipe by subtracting 25% from the butter, sugar and flour. One less egg is 1/4 less, which is 25%.

Cooking is a very simple example, but this concept becomes incredibly powerful as you apply it more. It will also allow you to make connections across what are usually considered isolated areas of knowledge.

For example:

- Ideas and religions compete for humans the same way virusses compete for hosts
- The internet works similar to the human nervous system
- Lightening follows the path of least resistance in a similar pattern as tree branches

The more you connect things, the easier it becomes to understand new things.

## Richard Feynman technique

Feynman was a physicist who was known for being able to explain nearly everything to nearly everyone. He exemplifies the concept that nothing is too difficult to understand. All it takes is the right understanding. The Feynman technique goes like this:

1. Explain a concept to a kid (real/imaginary)
2. Note down your gaps in knowledge
3. Research
4. Repeat

Many times people who think something is too hard to explain to a novice simply do not understand the concept well enough to break it down. Instead the talk in circles and make things harder than they need to be.

I personally have had great learning success explaining materials to a rubber duck. The key to this technique is that explaining something to someone who doesn't understand forces you to break down a problem.

Let's for example say you are studying gravity. If you tell a kid that gravity is a force that pulls things together you might get back all sorts of questions:

- Why do two apples not stick together?
- Why does a feather fall slower than a rock?
- Why does gravity exist?

You then turn to books, google and notes. In a second attempt you explain that gravity is proportional to the mass of an object, and we don't actually fully understand where it comes from. Meaning apples are drawn to eachother, but since they are small compared to for example the earth, you don't actually feel them stick to eachother. Gravity pulls on all objects equally hard, meaning a feather and a rock have the same pull from the earth. The reason they fall differently is because of the air. In a vaccuum they actually fall equally fast.

Now you are doing better, but new questions arise:

- What is a vaccuum? Do all things really fall equally fast in it?
- How large does something need to be to feel gravity from it?

And so on. Interestingly the latter of these questions has an answer that will border on biology and chemistry.

My personal workflow when learning is:

1. Formulate what I want to learn
2. Do research
3. Explain to an imaginary person (out loud!)
4. Figure out the holes
5. Research more
6. Go deeper and deeper until I feel satisfied

The thing with this technique is that if you get good enough at systems thinking you will go down seemingly irrelevant rabbit holes. Physics will lead you to ethics, psychology to biology and chemistry to painting. Go down these rabit holes as far as time permits. Be sure to keep your goal in mind.

## Choose the right content & structure

You can spend your entire life trying to learn to cook if you only read books on painting. The example may sound extreme, but the principle always apply. Choose your content wisely. A great approach is Tim Ferriss's DiSSS Approach. The steps in there are:

1. D - Deconstruct. What are the building blocks of this discipline? For example words in a language.
2. S - Selection. What building blocks give the best output? For example 20% of words with which you can have 80% of conversations.
3. S - Secuencing. What is the best order to learn elements? Don't assume the order of existing courses/books is the best one. Ask experts.
4. S - Stakes. See the motivation section. Set up a system that motivates you to keep going and punishes you for not continuing.

He suggests combining this with the CaFE approach:

1. C - Compression. Can the 20% most effective building blocks be represented in a one pager? A cheatsheet or something you can hang on the fridge for example.
2. F - Frequency. Schedule in an amount of learning that suits your needs and the discipline. Sometimes 10 mimutes a day can do a lot, but for other things it will not help you that much.
3. E - Encoding. Create mental anchors and tricks that work well for your mind. Things like mnemonics.

## Record your learnings in a reference format

The human mind is usually not very good at being exposed to knowledge once and then perfectly retaining it. Recording it has two benefits:

1. You can refer to it later
2. It forces you to compress and structure

It is very valuable to be able to refer back to what you have learned. Either to solidify your learning by repetition, or by refreshing your learnings a while after you have completed a piece of learning.

Additionally writing down your learnings in a structured format helps you better understand your the things you are learning.

Personally I enjoy writing down notes in a very terse format. Things that work very well for me are structured notes with bullet points as well as mindmaps. Specifically the use of graphics in them is very helpful.

Note that the goal of taking these notes is not to be coherent to someone other than you. THe biggest mistake you can make in documenting your learning is writing down too much. The goal of these notes is to be quick reference summaries for you personally. Often my notes and summaries make no sense to people who have not read the original material, but are very helpful to people who have read the original materials.
