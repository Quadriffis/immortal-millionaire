I'd like to convert the initial drafts into very actionable chapters. My initial instincs say a chapter should be able to be prepended with 'how to ...'

For the body

1. Lose weight
2. Gain muscle
3. Get flexible
4. Extend lifespan
5. Improve stress resistance

For the money:

1. Achieve financial independence
2. Do emotion-friendly budgetting
3. Calculate how much you need to stop working
4. Invest money so it generates more money
