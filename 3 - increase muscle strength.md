# Increase muscle strength

**Recipe**

1. Do high load exercises in low repititions
	- Do not do exercises to muscle failure
2. Do many repititions spaced out over the day

**Tools**

Suggested exercises

Progression one:

- Push up
- One handed push up
- One handed and one legged push up

Progression two:

- Squat
- Pistol squat (down only)
- Full pistol squat

If a pull up bar is available, pull ups ar great.

You may modulate the difficulty of any exercise by doing it slower. A 5 second push up is harder than a quick up/down for example.

## Why and how this works

### Strength is greatly neurological

While muscle size is one factor, it is not the only variable in muscle strength. The physical structure of the muscle determines theoretical output, like how many seconds it takes for a car to accelerate to a certain speed.

What matters in practice is how strong the neurological signal to exert force is. There is a safety limit on the percentage of strength a muscle can theoretically and practically produce.

> Electrocution or tetanus for example can cause the muscles to spasm violently enough to break bones.

When training for strength you are in essense helping your body understand how much strength is safe to use.

### Greasing the groove

A popular approach to strength rather than muscle size is *greasing the groove* as described by Pavel Tsatsouline. This protocol consists of three tennets:

1. High load (lots of effort)
2. Low consecutive repetitions (no exhaustion)
3. Regular repetitions throughout the day

The **high load** refers to the need to use muscles close to their strength limit. It's not about exhausting them but rather about making one repetition of a difficult move.

The **low repetition** element is linked to the above. If you can do 10 repetitions of a movement, it is not hard enough for this protocol.

The **regular repetitions** refer to doing the high-load movements often throughout the day. Where muscle growth asks you to do 20 heavy movements after each other, this protocol wants you to do single repetition sessions every hour or even half an hour.

The protocol as written by Pavel focuses on two body-weight exercises:

- One handed (+one legged) push up
- Pistol squat

These are highly technical moves that stimulate a large number of muscle groups. The one handed/legged push up for example stimulates everything from triceps to pectorals to core and even the upper leg.

The principles of this protocol however translate to many other exercises. Just keep in mind that this protocol is more dangerous with respect to injuries since you are training with high muscle load. Technique is even more important than with regular resistance training.

### Motivation and consistency

As with losing weight things like acountability are very important. But while weight loss is an all-day endeavor, exercise is often more about routine and consistency.

For hypertrophy/size training it is advisable to have certain days or times of day where you exercise. Personally I like going to the gym (and consecutively sauna) in the morning. Whatever works for you, schedule it. Put it in your calendar. Preferably have a friend or personal trainer to hold you accountable.
