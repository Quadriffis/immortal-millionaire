# Increase muscle strength

- Show working out puppet with a speedometer next to it with green/orange/red sections where there is a stop arrow where the gree ends
- Cartoon style windows where the puppet is doing exercises in different settings

1. Do high load exercises in low repititions
	- Do not do exercises to muscle failure
2. Do many repititions spaced out over the day

## Tools

**Suggested exercises**

Progression one:

- Pushup
- One handed pushup, downward motion only
- One handed pushup
- One handed and one legged push up

Progression two:

- Squat
- Pistol squat, downward motion only
- Full pistol squat

If a pull up bar is available, pull ups are great.

You may modulate the difficulty of any exercise by doing it slower. A 5 second push up is harder than a quick up/down for example.

## Why and how this works

### Strength is greatly neurological

While muscle size is one factor, it is not the only variable in muscle strength. The physical structure of the muscle determines theoretical output, like how many seconds it takes for a car to accelerate to a certain speed.

What matters in practice is how strong the neurological signal to exert force is. There is a safety limit on the percentage of strength a muscle can theoretically and practically produce.

> Electrocution or tetanus for example can cause the muscles to spasm violently enough to break bones.

When training for strength you are in essense helping your body understand how much strength is safe to use.

### Greasing the groove

A popular approach to strength rather than muscle size is *greasing the groove* as described by Pavel Tsatsouline. This protocol consists of three tennets:

1. High load (lots of effort)
2. Low consecutive repetitions (no exhaustion)
3. Regular repetitions throughout the day

The **high load** refers to the need to use muscles close to their strength limit. It's not about exhausting them but rather about making one repetition of a difficult move.

The **low repetition** element is linked to the above. If you can do 10 repetitions of a movement, it is not hard enough for this protocol.

The **regular repetitions** refer to doing the high-load movements often throughout the day. Where muscle growth asks you to do 20 heavy movements after each other, this protocol wants you to do single repetition sessions every hour or even half an hour.

The protocol as written by Pavel focuses on two body-weight exercises:

- One handed (+one legged) push up
- Pistol squat

These are highly technical moves that stimulate a large number of muscle groups. The one handed/legged push up for example stimulates everything from triceps to pectorals to core and even the upper leg.

The principles of this protocol however translate to many other exercises. Just keep in mind that this protocol is more dangerous with respect to injuries since you are training with high muscle load. Technique is even more important than with regular resistance training.

### Motivation and consistency

As with losing weight things like acountability are very important. But while weight loss is an all-day endeavor, exercise is often more about routine and consistency.

For hypertrophy/size training it is advisable to have certain days or times of day where you exercise. Personally I like going to the gym (and consecutively sauna) in the morning. Whatever works for you, schedule it. Put it in your calendar. Preferably have a friend or personal trainer to hold you accountable.

## How I found out

It took me a while to realise that muscle size and strength are not proportional per se. People like Pavel Tsatsuline said it many times. What really drove it home for me was a discovery channel episode of Stan Lee's superhumans.

This particular episode covered a man called Dennis Rogers, an reasonably unassuming looking guy who proceeded to bend pans, wrenches and other miscellaneous items with his bare hands.

Of course the tv show made a big show out of calling him the strongest man in the world, but I just couldn't deny that this man's strength to size ratio turned all the bro-science spoken around the gym on its head.

From that moment on I took the whole strength vs size thesis more seriously. The common theme in recommendations on strength training I would included:

- Eccentric motion is more important
- Muscle exhaustion is undesirable

Eccentric refers to the negative part of an exercise, the part where the muscle stretches. For example the downward part of a squat.

I started experimenting with all sorts of exercises, mostly in the gym. After listening to a podcast featuring Pavel Tsatsuline I obtained some of his books. In particular one called The Naked Warrior.

This book caught my eye because it focussed on bodyweight training only. The appeal of that approach to me is that I can keep practicing when traveling or am otherwise unable to got to a gym.

The book focussed on only 2 exercises:

- Pistol squat
- Push up on one hand & one leg

The book also stressed the 'greasing the groove' approach, which sees strength as a skill. Under the motto of practice makes perfect, the book recommends:

- Doing intense exercises
- Never training to failure

The first translates to practicing the strength of skill by tackling an exercise you find difficult. The second means you do not push your body to the poing where you can't do any more exercises after.

In practice the recommendations came down to doing pistol squats and one hand/leg pushups throughout the day, getting your total count up as high as you can without ever exhausting your muscles.

The result of this is a signal to your nerve system that you are trying to use your muscles for more strength without triggering the muscle exhaustion response that is most effective for muscle gain. The result is more strength without all that much muscle gain.

The journey to reaching the point where I am now took a while. For the one handed pushups it took me a while to build my way up. In the beginning it took all my willpower to only do a downward motion one handed pushup, but as I kept doing them throughout the day my strength levels increased reliably.

The nice and yet odd element of this approach is that you will be doing pushups in the strangest places. I made it a routine to do some one handed pushups in the bathroom before I washed my hands for example.

The pistol squat was even harder for me. Not just because it takes a lot of strength, but also because it requires balance and flexibility. For me specifically the achilles and calf were so tight that I would fall backward whenever I attempter a pistol squat. I worked my way up by:

- Stretching the achilles
- Holding some weight in my hands for balance
- Holding chairs/tables/etc for balance

By now a pistol squat is no problem whatsoever, but it did take some time to get there.

I've also realised that a little warmup is needed for these kinds of intense exercises. Nothing extreme, but if you are going to do a one handed pushup at least warm up your hip and shoulder joints a bit.

My current exercise routine heavily depends on daily pistol squats and one handed & legged pushups. They are great portable exercises that activate a large set of muscles. Combined with a stretching routine (see stretching chapter) it takes care of daily physical fitness very effectively.
