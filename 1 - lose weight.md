# Lose weight

1. Decrease the amount of calories you consume
	- Generate a list of 'whitelisted' foods
	- Generate a number of meals with these foods
2. Institute routines
4. Set up accountability

## Tools

**Suggested food whitelist**

| What stuff | How much | Notes |
| -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Vegetables that grow above ground | As much as you want | E.g. cauliflower but not potato. |
| Meat & fish | Normal portions | Prefer lean, but fatty is fine. |
| Fermented dairy | Normal portions | E.g. Yoghurt, cheeze. Only unsweetened. |
| Fruit | Very limited intake | Consider fruit candy. It's satiety effect is very short. |
| Nuts | Very limited intake | While low GI, 100g macadamia nuts is 700 kCal. Equivalent to 4.5kg cucumber. |
| Can I eat... | Zero | If you need to ask, then you don't eat it. No 'superfood grains' or 'sugar free' snacks. Simplicity. |

**Sugested meal types**

| Meal | Instructions |
| ---- | ------------ |
| Soup | Boil vegetables, add salt, blend them (heat proof blender). |
| Salad | Chop things up, add olive oil and balsamic. Eat. |
| Stirfried | Chop vegetables, put in pan with hot oil, stir until they are soft-ish. |
| Yoghurt with fruits | Yoghurt + fruit in bowl. Spoon it. |

**Suggested routines**

| Trigger | Action | Notes |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- |
| Waking up | 30 grams of protein within 30 mins | 5 eggs or 1 big protein shake. |
| Waking up | 500ml (1 big cups) water | Cold water preferred. |
| Hungry at non-meal time | Savory broth | Any whitelist food is fine, but zero-sugar broth packages are easy to cary around. |

**Never whitelist**

| Food | Severity | Example | Why |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | --- |
| Sugar | Nuclear | Sugar in coffee | No satiety, lots of energy |
| Drinks with energy content (kCal) | Nuclear | Fruit juice, soda | High calorie per second intake. Little satiety. |
| Soft/white carbohydrates | High | Bagel, pasta | Low satiety, high energy |
| Sweet fruits | Moderate | Dates, figs, grapes, cherry | Fruits have a short lived effect on satiety and a high GI. Bad for weight loss, fine for long term health. |

*Note: there are exceptions to all of these. There are very good pastas for example that are decent in satiety and not too bad in GI. When trying to lose weight, don't complicate your life by adding 'maybe, it depends' foods. Simplicity.*

**Suggested accountability**

Either go with a betting pool, or use a service like Stickk[^stickk.com is a free service that will donate your money to a charity you hate if you don't commit to your goals.] to set up a donation to a charity you hate. Do not choose a charity you like, Stickk is a deterrent for you, it must hurt you to lose. At Stickk you will choose a good (but stern) friend who will decide whether you stuck to your goals.

## Why and how this works

Weightloss is simple.

The human body is a complex system, but it handles energy in accordance to the laws of thermodynamics.

> Weight change = energy intake - energy expenditure

Humans measure the energy they consume in calories[^Or more specifically kilocalories (kCal).]. The above means simply that:

- If you eat more energy than you expend: you gain weight
- If you eat less energy than you expend: you lose weight

There are other dimensions to body recomposition, but those are mostly psycholgical. How to tackle those we will handle later on.

For anyone that thinks their body does not conform to this principle: If this were true, your body would be breaking the laws of physics. I assure you it is not.

That said, there are people whos genetics make it easier or harder to lose weight. This is often due to their genetic food preferences[^Fun fact. People who grew up hungry have higher risk of diabetes because their body responded by increasing food cravings. It't not magic, it's science.].

The main principle for weight loss is thus simply:

> To lose weight, eat less calories than you expend. To gain weight eat more calories than you expend.

### Losing weight happens in the kitchen

Your body needs energy to stay alive. The majority of the energy you use every day is used to pump blood, keep you warm and have your brain running.

The energy used to keep you alive is called Base Metabolic Rate (BMR). It is far greater than the energy you expend doing sports.

The average BMR can be estimated with this calculation:

- Women BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kilos) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years)
- Men BMR = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kilos) + (5 x height in cm) - (6.8 x age in years)

> For a 26 year old male of 183cm weighing 78 kilos that means a BMR of 66 + (13.7*80) + (5*170) + (6.8*26) = **2188 kCal a day**.

This same male would burn about **250 kCal** for a half hour of aerobic sports.

In other words, to use the amount of calories he burns by going about his day is equivalent of 9 half hour sports sessions.

If you want to do sports, good. But don't do it to lose weight. Change your food to lose weight.

### Satiety index

Your body does not feel full based on the calories you eat. The satiety system responds to different factors, ranging from stomach fullness to lipids in your digestive system.

Some rules of thumb

| Filling | Not filling |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Protein | Fat (ish) |
| Fiber | Sugars |

Fat is an interesting one. It does trigger the satiety response, but the effect is **delayed**. Basically it fill you, but only after half an hour or so.

An interesting technique based on the satiety system is taking 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking. It suppresses apetite for a good amount of time.

### Glycemic index

Your body transforms all carbohydrates into sugar. This is why all carbohydrates increase your blood sugar levels, but fats do not.

Depending on the carbohydrate type and it's packaging your blood sugar will spike to different degrees.

- Table sugar is absorbed as sugar, thus spikes your blood sugar a lot
- Pumpkin takes your body a while to break down, and then a while to break it's starches down into sugar. It doesn't spike blood sugar all that much

A high glycemic index (high blood sugar spike) is bad for weight loss. Your body is more likely to store the energy as fat, plus most high GI foods are not that filling compared to their low GI counterparts. This is a rule of thumb and not universal.

One note: the glycemic index is a carbohydrate specific measure. A more 'real world' measure is the glycemic load. Which takes into account the whole meal/food contents. It's harder to calculate on the go though.

Rules of thumb to identify high GI foods:

| Level | Guestimated GI |
| ----- | -------------- |
| High (bad) | 'White' carbohydrates like sugar, flour, bread, potato, rice, etc. |
| Medium (all right) | Sweet plants like fruits and starchy vegetables |
| Low (good) | Protein rich foods. Non/less sweet/starchy plants like leafs. |
| None (no impact) | Pure fats. Water. |

### Whitelist, not blacklist

When losing weight you want to rely on your willpower as little as possible. Every time you have to make a decision on the spot there is a chance you will make a bad decision.

Therefore, don't choose the foods you will syat away from. Rather choose the only foods you will eat.

Instead of blacklisting:

> I will not eat candy, not drink soda, drink less sweet juice, put no sugar in my coffee, etc

Go with whitelisting:

> I will only eat meats, eggs and vegetables.

It is simpler and less error prone. If you want to make your weight loss period even more fool proof, take a lesson from the Slow Carb diet and plan a set amount of meals and only eat those.

### Accountability & motivation

Humans are not very good at making a decision and sticking to it. Therefore it is advisable to make a system that supports you in (read: forces you to) stick to your intention.

Humans are more risk averse than goal oriented. If you give a person €10 they will be happy. If you give them €20 and later steal €10 from them they will be sad. Even though in both scenarios they end up with €10. Use this to your advantage.

Popular options:

| Strategy | Logistics |
| -------- | --------- |
| Betting pool | Set a goal with friends, put money into a pot (enough to hurt, not enough to be impractical) first to reach the goal gets the money, rest loses. |
| Punishment | Give a friend/service money. If you don't reach the goal, they donate it to a charity/cause you hate. (e.g. the kkk) |

**Formulate the cost of failure**

Inspiration is fickle and temporary. You can keep it alive by continuously reminding yourself of the cost of failure and the profit of winning. It pays to formulate your cost/benefit reasons.

An example list, 'if I do not reach a healthy weight I will':

- Feel inferior to those around me
- Not have the energy to go for hikes
- Die younger than I need to

An example list, 'if I reach my desired weight I will':

- Feel proud of my body
- Feel good about my discipline
- Be able to enjoy physical activities better

Your reasons will always be your own. Formulate what matters to you and remind your self of them at key moments:

- Recite your costs/gains to yourself in the mirror in the morning
- Go through your costs/gains before every meal

### What gets measured gets managed

Measure your progress every day. Your first priority should be logging your weight. You can use an old-school scale and a notebook or a smart scale that makes pretty graphs. Notes on weight management:

- Measure at the same time of day each day for consistency
- Body fat % on scales are not accurate. Use them only for trends.

For those who like numbers, calorie counting is a great option. To be effective:

1. Set a calorie goal
2. Measure your intake

For the people who like accuracy, get an app that had accurate calorie counts for foods, there are plenty of free and good ones. A kitchen scale is your friend. 

Rules of thumb:

| Food | Guestimated calories per 100g | Example |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ------- |
| Vegetable | 30 kCal | Asparagus, cauliflower, carrots |
| Fruit (N-European) | 50 kCal | Apple, berries |
| Fruit (Warm places) | 100 kCal | Pomegranate, banana, grapes |
| Starchy vegetable | 100 kCal | Potato, peas |
| Cheese | 300 kCal | All except explicitly low fat |
| Fish lean/fatty | 50/150 kCal | Trout / eel |
| Lean/reg/fat meat | 100/200/400 kCal | Chicken/Beef/Sausage |
| Egg small/large | 50/75 kCal | |

The above is stupidly oversimplified. But *measuring something always beats measuring nothing.*
