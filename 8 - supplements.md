# Supplements

Supplements should be exactly what they name implies, supplemental consumptions. They are not designed to replace a varied diet that supplies the nutrients your body needs. They can however offer ways to:

- correct deficiencies
- offer benefits that regular foods do not

## Get your blood tested

Many people seem intent on using supplements blindly. It is in most developed countries however trivial to get a blood panel that tests for useful values.

Note however that blood tests are not like opening the door to a room to see what is inside. You can't just "test your blood" and expect a list of results to come back. You need to test for specific things.

For each of the things you test for there is probably a different test that needs to be run on your blood. It is therefore vital to know what you want to test for.

Some interesting values include common deciciencies like:

- Vitamin d
- Vitamin B12
- Magnesium

Some values are useful simly to have a baseline of your usual values, these include:

- Iron
- Lipid panel (cholesterol etc)
- Certain hormones

Note that not all values have immediate value. Cholesterol values for example are not all that useful for many young people. Having some baseline readings however can be valuable in future scenarios.

## Common deficiencies & supplements

On a statistical basis there are a number of supplements that could benefit a great many people.

Note that statistics can be deceiving. If for example 50% of a population is deficient in vitamin B12, that might convince you to take the supplement. If the underlying data however shows that the 50% that has this issue is over 65 years old, you may or may not change your standpoint.

Don't blindly take supplements:

1. Get your blood tested
2. Make a game plan (supplements/food)
3. Test again a few weeks later

### Vitamin D

Vitamin d is a steroid hormone. That is to say that this substance has the ability to reach the cell nucleus (where the DNA is kept) and unfluence what genes are expressed. In other words: vitamin d changes what part of your DNA is on and off.

Humans have two main sources of vitamin d:

- Food
- The sun

Foods high in vitamin d include for example fatty fish. One stereotypial example is cod liver oil.

Our skin is able to generate vitamin d from sunlight as well. The problem there is that in the recent parts of human existance we've spent a lot of time indoors and covering 90% of our skin surface area with sun blocking clothing.

Some common reasons for low vitamin d levels include:

- Sitting inside all day
- Having darker skin in countries with less sun
- Wearing clothing that covers a lot of skin

The effects of low vitamin d can be manifold (remember, it affects DNA expression):

- Lower mood levels
- Suboptimal immune function
- Suboptimal cognitive function
- Weaker bone and teeth

### Magnesium

This mineral is used in a large amount of functions ranging from the immune system to the brain. It's used ny 300+ enzymes and without it our primary ATP based cellular energy system would not function. 

There are no international population wide statistics on magnesium levels in the blood, but depending on what study you look at as many as 60% to 80% of people care deficient in magnesium.

There are a number of issues for many people:

> Many people don't consume enough magnesium and magnesium supplements are often bad

The issue with magnesium supplements is that different types are absorbed better or worse. Not only that, but it appears that different types are prefered by certain organs.

The important magnesium types to know:

| Type | Bioavailability | Notes |
| --- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Magnesium Oxide | As low as 10% | Basically magnesium rust |

You can check for the type of magnesium in your supplement by checking the ingredient list.

### The harm of supplements

Vitamin supplements are not without risk. Many people approach it with a "worst case it doesn't do anything" attitude. The thing is that vitamins too can upset the balance of your body.

The B vitamin group for example is well known to stimulate certain types of growth. This is why people take it to make nails and hair grow faster/stronger. Hypothetically however these supplements could also provide valuable fuel for tumors.

Likewise for many male consumers taking extra iron is a terrible idea and has shown to increase risk for some disease, whereas this is less so the case for women (who lose iron through menstruation).

> Don't get me wrong: no supplement is inheretly good or bad

Blindly taking highly concentrated supplements is a terrible idea though. Test yourself first.

## Interesting supplements

There are a number of supplements that have the potential to support a good quality of life, or to extend lifespan potentially. Many of these are quite exterimental and have only proven to work in theory or on animal models.

### Lithium Ororate

Lithium is associated in high dosages with the treatment of psycheatric disorders. It is however in low dosages an essential mineral for optimal health. It occurs naturally in low dosages (up to 0.170 mg/L in tap water)[^lithium]. The argument has been made that we could all benefit from a low dosage of lithium on a daily basis.[^lithium]

While large theraputic dosages are classified as medicine (and rightfully so) the smaller dosed supplements are available for purchase from many supplement vendors. The dosages are greatly smaller than those in the medicinal form.

### Collagen

The human skin is kept in shape by a scaffold made of a protein structure called collagen. This part of the 'extracellular matrix' gives skin elasticity and keeps it from wrinkling. Damage to the collagen structure is done by UVA radiation, which causes wrinkles. This is why dermatologists hammer on using sunscreen all day every day.

While preventing damage by means of sunscreen is good advice, is doesn't help your body to repair damage that is bound to occur because of daily sun exposure.

> Note that sun exposure is positive for many health factors, the downside to the positive effects is skin aging.

Intuitively it makes sense that if a certain structure in the body breaks down (collagen) you can stimulate growth by consuming more building blocks (in the form of said collagen). While the body it very cabable of conctructing collagen from other protein sources, consuming collagen as such seems to have positive effects on skin elasticity.

Studies have shown that radioactively labelled collagen (it's a harmless kind of study) can be traced to places in the body where collagen is present. A small placebo controlled study found that indeed consuming collagen increases skin elasticity after a few weeks.

Note that those looking to supplement collagen don't have to put up with dissolving regular collagen into hot water and drink a foul smelling mixture. There are great hydrolysed collagen supplements on the market that smell quite neutral and dissolve in cold water.

### Metformin

Originally a diabetes drug, this compound has shown promise in the fiels of life extension. It gained popularity in recent years, especially in places like silicon valley where self-experimentation is quite widespread.

Depending on your country this compound may or may not be available for sale without perscription. Regardless of availability it is advisable to cosult a medical professional before choosing to take a compound with strong effects like metformin.

### Rapamicin

Named after Rapanui (easter island) this compound has stayed in the shadows for a large number of years. Research seems to indicate that through effects on the FOXO and mTor pathways this compound increases longevity.

The research on humans however is not very extensive and the availability is low as of the time of writing. It is not a common drug or supplement and is considered experimental.

### Adaptogens

The class of adaptogens is a group of supplements that balances stress and relaxation responses. In essence these compounds give energy for those who are low and provide relaxation to those who are stressed.

This may sound conflicting, but it makes sense when viewed through the lens that adaptogens work at restoring a baseline. Instead of a substance that per definition causes a dose-dependent effect in a predicatble direction (e.g. alcohol) they restore balance to functions that are out of whack.

The exact mechanisms differ per supplement, and for some the exact mechanisms are not known. For many though the adaptogenic effect has been robustly documented.

Interesting adaptogens include:

- Panax Ginseng root
- Reishi mushroom extracts
- Rhodiola

Depending on your geographcial location some are easier to find than others.

### Fish oil (omega 3's)

Fish oil is known as a beneficial supplement in pop culture. The effects that are often tauted include their beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system and cholesterol levels. More and more research however seems to indicate that omega 3 fatty acids also have many benefits for neurological attributes like cognitive function and mood levels.

For this supplement it is important to realise that fatty acids are essential for the structure and functioning of cells. In essence human cells are bags of water, willed with molecular machinery (DNA, mitochondria etc). The 'bag' that is the border of the cell basically uses lipids as an important building block. The right lipids keep the cell membrane flexible and functioning optimally. This is very important for many things, including nerve function.

On supplement bottles you will often find references to EPA and DHA. These are two forms of omega 3 fatty acids. Their structure differs and research indicates that their effect differs as well.

If you plan to take fish oil on a long term basis make sure that you choose a reputable supplement that is adequately purified. The fish used to produce the oil may contain toxins like heavy metals (especially if the source fish is high up the food chain) that need to be filtered out.
