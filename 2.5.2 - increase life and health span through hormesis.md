# Increase life and health span through hormesis

Your body is your most complex and valueble posession. It's anatomy is the result of billions of years of adaptation to complex, varying and hostile environments. You can't use language to tell your body to activate it's self-preservation mechanisms. Luckily, there are other ways.

**Principles for using hormesis**

- Hormesis is the controlled triggering of the body's defenses
- More is not always better, this depends on how the body responds
- Fasting is one of the most powerful hormetic triggers

**In this chapter**

- Ways to safely trigger metabolic self defence reactions
- Different approaches to fasting for health

## Hormesis is the activation of defences

The human body evolved in nature, which can be a very hostile environment. In order to survive as a species we've had to develop ways to deal with things like:

- Temperature exposure
- Starvation
- Strenuous muscle use
- Toxic chemicals in plants
- Radiation exposure (UV from the sun)

In order to deal with this the human body has a host of defense mechanisms. Because defense costs energy, these mechanisms are only activated when needed. For example, if we get bombarded with radiation (sun) we develop a shield of melanin pigment (tanning). We call this process of activating defenses _hormesis_.

Hormesis has 2 interesting properties:

1. It overcompensates
2. Mechanisms are generalised

The overcompensation means that a little of a stressor can cause a disproportionately strong defense. The generalised mechanisms means that the body doesn't have highly specific defenses but rather a handful of areas. For example, cold exposure and heat exposure both cause the body to make heat schock proteins.

Because of these two characteristics we can activate the body's defenses with harmless stimuli. These harmless stimuli are sometimes perceived as harmful, causing the body to strengthen itself. For example saunas (heat exposure) have been shown to decrease a number of disease risks. Likewise exercise (muscle stress) has many benefits. Drinking tea (a toxin) too can have benefits for health and longevity.

**Hormetic responses in a controlled environment:**

| Trigger | Intensity/frequency |
| ------- | --------- |
| Sauna | More[^As measured by the amount of days per week you enter the sauna] & hotter[^Commonly researched temperatures are 80 and 100 degrees celcius] appears to be better[^See [this excellent sauna breakdown](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/sauna-report.pdf) by dr Rhonda Pattrick] |
| Cold exposure | Colder is better, duration is less important[^20 seconds at 4.4 Celsius appeared equal to 2 minutes at -110 Celsius cryotherapy. See [Effects of long‐term whole‐body cold exposures on plasma concentrations of ACTH, beta‐endorphin, cortisol, catecholamines and cytokines in healthy females](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00365510701516350)]. The minimum temperature seems to be around the 14 Celsius mark[^See [Human physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004210050065)] |
| Intermittent fasting | Common approaches are 16/8[^16 hours of fasting per day, 8 hour eating window] and 5/2[^5 days of regular eating followed by 2 days of fasting or low caloric intake]. I use 16/8. |
| Multi-day fasting | While water fasts are most optimal a 5 day fast mimicking diet approach has many of the same benefits |

This chapter covers things you can expose your body to in a controlled fashion that can result in net positive effects.

## Green vs Black Tea

Tea is often tauted as a healthy drink. It turns out that tea has a likely hormetic response that is dose-dependent. In other words, in some quantities it boosts health and in others it doesn't. A meta study that analysed 18 green and black tea studies[^See [Tea consumption and mortality of all cancers, CVD and all causes: A meta-analysis of eighteen prospective cohort studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280390906_Tea_consumption_and_mortality_of_all_cancers_CVD_and_all_causes_A_meta-analysis_of_eighteen_prospective_cohort_studies)] found some interesting things:

1. Black tea had a positive effect on **cancer** and **all-cause** mortality
2. Green tea had a positive effect on **cardiovascular** and **all-cause** mortality

All-cause mortality basically refers to the odds of someone dying for any reason. If you remove some nuance:

- Green tea and black tea seem to increase lifespan
- Green tea seems to reduce cardiovascular disease risk
- Black tea seems to reduce cancer risk

Additionally there is a dose-dependent response they found that indicates that:

1. Green tea has positive effects for 1-4 cups a day and the effect **decreases** but doesn't reverse if you drink more
2. Black tea has positive effects for 1-2 cups a day but the effect **reverses** if you drink more

One can hypothesise that there are substances in tea that are mild toxins. In a low dose these trigger our defenses, in higher doses they harm us. I personally translate the above into drinking green tea during the day, with a max of 2 black.

## Heat & cold exposure

This is not about food, but rather temperature stressors. The body gains a lot of benefit from controlled extreme heat exposure (sauna).

Particularly saunas are in many countries relatively easy to implement as habits through gyms that offer them. Benefits of saunas include[^For a well-referenced overview of benefits of sauna use see [dr Rhonda Pattrick's sauna report](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/sauna-report.pdf)] both physical and mental effects.

As for frequency, research so far seems to indicate that more is better. Going twice a week beats once, going 5 times beats 4, etc.

The opposite of controlled heat exposure, controlled extreme cold exposure (ice baths), also confers a number of benefits[^For a well-referenced overview of cold exposure research check out [dr Rhonda Pattrick's cold stress report](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/cold-stress.pdf)].

| Effect | Stressor |
| ------ | -------- |
| Athletic endurance | Heat & cold |
| Increased lifespan[^In animal research and human models, it's all very experimental and not at all 100% proven] | Heat & cold |
| Heat shock protein production | Heat & cold |

| Muscle growth | Heat[^Cold when applied right after exercise actually reduces muscle growth gains] |
| Increased insulin sensitivity | Heat |
| Increased neurogenesis[^The creation of new neurons in the brain] | Heat |
| Improved cardiovascular function | Heat |
| Growth hormone release | Heat |
| Increases red blood cell count | Heat |

| Cold shock proteins | Cold |
| Reduced inflammation | Cold |
| White blood cell increase | Cold |
| Increased brown fat & thermogenesis | Cold |

## Fasting & feasting

The human body has two interesting metabolic states:

- Build stuff
- Destroy/repair broken stuff

The building cycle is important since it is the time when we build new cells, proteins and so on. The destroy/repair state is important since broken cells and components can result in nasty things like cancer.

The caveat here is that these states can't optimally function at the same time. When the build state is dominant the repair state is less active and vice versa.

Interestingly *eating stimulates building* and *fasting stimulates repair*. In other words, feeding your body will trigger it to use those nutrients. Not feeding your body will allow your body to repair itself on a cellular level.

- Fasting triggers repair
- Feasting triggers growth

One issue our society has is that we don't give the body enough time to enter the fasting restorative mode. We eat pretty much the whole time we're awake.

There are a number of fasting 'levels' to be aware of:

| Fasting type | Effect |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Juice fast/cleanse | This is *not* fasting. It'll rest your intestines a bit but has little metabolic effect. |
| No calorie fast | Nothing with energy (caloric) content. Coffee/tea is fine, but only without sugar and milk. This is good for fasting, but might reduce some of the benefits related to elevated oxidative stress. |
| Water fast | The most effective fast usually. Harder to use in regular life. |
| Full fast | No water, no food. While the most pure fast the benefits compared to a water fast are not that much. |

When talking about fasting we must briefly discuss ketosis. The body usually relies on a glycolytic pathway for energy. In other words, we usually run on carbohydrates. The body mostly supplies energy to the muscle and brain through blood sugar.

For many people this is the reason they feel low when they have not eaten (low blood sugar) or when they have just eaten (blood sugar spike followed by insulin spike). There is an alternative energy mechanism called ketosis. In this state the body does not primarily break down carbohydrates but rather fats. Instead of using blood sugar for primary energy delivery, the body uses ketones.

Being in ketosis has a host of health benefits. The list is very similar to fasting. Indeed a great deal of the benefits of fasting stem from the fact that fasting helps trigger ketosis. Entering a ketotic state is done by depriving the body of carbohydrates. A ketogenic diet is often 80%+ fats. Longer fasts too result in ketosis, and thus supply benefits similar to the ketogenic diet.

### The benefits of fasting

The average human body can live for 3 days without water and 3 weeks without food. On a biological level not eating for a full day is really not that extreme. Many have argued that in the human hunter/gather days it was quite common to eat a lot one day (caught an animal) and nothing the next (caught no animal).

Fasting and intermittent fasting have shown a number of interesting effects on both animals and humans. Note that this is very recent research so it's all still very experimental.

So far there are strong indications for:

- Reduced risk for certain cancers
- Reduced risk of mental disease
- Increased lifespan

There are a lot of cellular and metabolic effects that you can read about online[^See [The science of fasting for longevity & health](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/i-didnt-eat-for-105-hours-science-benefits/)]. While any extreme lifestyle change should be discussed with a medical professional, there are for most people no significant health risks involved in fasting.

### Time restricted feeding

While not strictly speaking a fasting strategy, time restricted eating is a time-dependent method of eating.The human body has an internal clock referred to as the circadian rhythm. There are two important factors that help your body calibrate it's clock:

- The first moment you are exposed to bright light
- The first moment you use your liver

Bright light is a 'sunrise' mechanism. The liver is used to digest food, but is also impacted by for example coffee.

There as strong indications that eating within a window that falls in the waking 'daylight' time (e.g. 08:00 to 20:00) has health benefits.

### Intermittent fasting

It takes the body a while to enter recovery mode once you start fasting. When you eat something during a fasted state the countdown timer starts anew. In other words, if you have a juice after fasting for 5 hours, your fast is now broken and you have now fasted for 0 hours.

One approach to implementing fasting into your life is intermittent fasting. Popular approaches include:

*The 16/8 approach* where you only eat for 8 consecutive hours a day and fast the rest of the day. For example only eating between 16:00 and 24:00. When the window is doesn't matter (caveats later on), what matters is that for 16 hours you do not eat or drink anything with caloric content. Most fasters do still consume coffee and tea without milk and sugar.

*The 5/2 approach* in which you eat regularly for 5 days a week but eat very little or nothing 2 days a week. While health benefits can be found when 2 days are very low on energy consumption, the body will only fully benefit if there is a period of actual fasting.

*Alternate day fasting* is exactly what it sounds like. You eat for one day, and do not eat the next.

**Template: Intermittent fasting**

The most popular option (and most compatible with most people's lives is the 16/8 approach. To get started, choose your eight hour eating window. Keep in mind that the window needs to:

- Cover all your energy needs. E.g. 08:00 to 16:00 requires dinner before 16:00
- Be conducive to finding food. Evenings work best if you work full time and cook at home.
- Compatible with your daily routine, think work(out)/social etc

Other important considerations:

- Most people report having the best mental focus when **fasting**.
- After adjusting many people report feeling sluggish when eating too early.
- Eat the right stuff, start with a protein rich meal (for the sake of satiety). Focus on low GI etc. See the diet section.
- Have backup food on you. E.g. always have a box of nuts on you.
- Be strict but reasonable. Yearly family brunches are a fine reason not to fast.
- Biologically eating earlier in the day is advantageous due to the circadian rhythm

### Fast mimicking diet

Longer fasts result in more dramatic health benefits. They are however also harder to do, and are not practical for certain target groups. It is for example known that fasting reduces some side effects of chemotherapy. Having a cancer patient fast is often not responsible or doable though.

Dr Valter Longo pioneered a multi-day fasting approach[^See his book [The Longevity Diet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35697130-the-longevity-diet)] that still allows for some nutrition, but is very selective in what one is allowed to eat. The idea is to keep the effects of fasting, while not fasting entirely.

The tenets of this approach are:

- 5 day fast
- Low caloric intake (sub 1000 kCal)
- Low protein & carbohydrate (under 10% & 50%)
- High fat (over 40%)

Self experimenters online also suggest using only high medium-chain-triglyceride oil like coconut oil as an energy source. Supplementation with salt is also advised since the body loses salt when glycogen stores are depleted during fasting.

**Template: 5 day fast mimicking diet**

In his book dr Longo specifically recommends:

**Day one**

- 500 kcal from vegetables (complex carbohydrates)
- 500 kcal from healthy fat (olive oil, nuts)
- 25 grams of plant based protein (nuts mostly)
- Multivitamin & omega 3 supplementation
- Sugarless tea (max 4 cups)
- Unlimited water

**Day 2-5**

- 400 kcal from vegetables (complex carbohydrates)
- 400 kcal from healthy fat (olive oil, nuts)
- Multivitamin & omega 3 supplementation
- Sugarless tea (max 4 cups)
- Unlimited water

**Day 6**
- Eat comlpex carbohydrates
- Minimise protein, saturated fat and sugar intake

**Template: Multi-day keto fast mimicking diet**

This is an interpretation of the fast mimicking diet designed to support you reaching ketosis. It is a more die-hard version of a fast-mimicking diet and has not been researched like the fast mimicking diet. I recommend using the above fast mimicking diet and only attempt this if you are a self-experimenter who knows what they are doing. *First off, a multi day fast is quite extreme. Consult a medical professional if this is your first time.*

The rules are simple:

| Hours/day | Rules |
| --- | ----- |
| 24h (day 1) | Coffee, tea, max 4 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| 48h (day 2) | Water. Max 2 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| 72h (day 3) | Water. Max 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| 98h (day 4) | Water. Max 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| 122h (day 4) | Water. Max 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| day 6 | Breakfast. |

The coconut oil is rich in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) which are easy to convert into ketones. It is recommended to buy a device to measure your blood ketones[^For example the Abbott Freestyle Optium Neo. You need to get both glucose and ketone strips. Ketone strips are markedly more expensive than glucose ones.]. Urine strips are not very accurate.

Tips to make the most out of your fast:

- Have things to do
- Don't be around food if you don't have to be
- Go for a brisk 1 hour walk on the first day (help get into ketosis)
- If you must have coffee/tea the whole duration (very suboptimal!) go for teas without antioxidants/caffeine (e.g. camomile) and coffee without sugar/milk.
