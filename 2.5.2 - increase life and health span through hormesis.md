# Increase life and health span through hormesis

Your body is your most complex and valueble posession. It's anatomy is the result of billions of years of adaptation to complex, varying and hostile environments. You can't use language to tell your body to activate it's self-preservation mechanisms. Luckily, there are other ways.

**Principles for using hormesis**

**In this chapter**

## Hormesis is the activation of defences

The human body evolved in nature, which can be a very hostile environment. In order to survive as a species we've had to develop ways to deal with things like:

- Temperature exposure
- Starvation
- Strenuous muscle use
- Toxic chemicals in plants
- Radiation exposure (UV from the sun)

In order to deal with this the human body has a host of defense mechanisms. Because defense costs energy, these mechanisms are only activated when needed. For example, if we get bombarded with radiation (sun) we develop a shield of melanin pigment (tanning). We call this process of activating defenses _hormesis_.

Hormesis has 2 interesting properties:

1. It overcompensates
2. Mechanisms are generalised

The overcompensation means that a little of a stressor can cause a disproportionately strong defense. The generalised mechanisms means that the body doesn't have highly specific defenses but rather a handful of areas. For example, cold exposure and heat exposure both cause the body to make heat schock proteins.

Because of these two characteristics we can activate the body's defenses with harmless stimuli. These harmless stimuli are sometimes perceived as harmful, causing the body to strengthen itself. For example saunas (heat exposure) have been shown to decrease a number of disease risks. Likewise exercise (muscle stress) has many benefits. Drinking tea (a toxin) too can have benefits for health and longevity.

**Hormetic responses in a controlled environment:**

| Trigger | Intensity/frequency |
| ------- | --------- |
| Sauna | More[^As measured by the amount of days per week you enter the sauna] & hotter[^Commonly researched temperatures are 80 and 100 degrees celcius] appears to be better[^See [this excellent sauna breakdown](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/sauna-report.pdf) by dr Rhonda Pattrick] |
| Cold exposure | Colder is better, duration is less important[^20 seconds at 4.4 Celsius appeared equal to 2 minutes at -110 Celsius cryotherapy. See [Effects of long‐term whole‐body cold exposures on plasma concentrations of ACTH, beta‐endorphin, cortisol, catecholamines and cytokines in healthy females](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00365510701516350)]. The minimum temperature seems to be around the 14 Celsius mark[^See [Human physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004210050065)] |
| Intermittent fasting | Common approaches are 16/8[^16 hours of fasting per day, 8 hour eating window] and 5/2[^5 days of regular eating followed by 2 days of fasting or low caloric intake]. I use 16/8. |
| Multi-day fasting | While water fasts are most optimal a 5 day fast mimicking diet approach has many of the same benefits |

This chapter covers things you can expose your body to in a controlled fashion that can result in net positive effects.

## Heat & cold exposure

This is not about food, but rather temperature stressors. The body gains a lot of benefit from controlled extreme heat exposure (sauna).

Particularly saunas are in many countries relatively easy to implement as habits through gyms that offer them.

Benefits of saunas include[^For a well-referenced overview of benefits of sauna use see [dr Rhonda Pattrick's sauna report](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/sauna-report.pdf)]:

As for frequency, research so far seems to indicate that more is better. Going twice a week beats once, going 5 times beats 4, etc.

The opposite of controlled heat exposure, controlled extreme cold exposure (ice baths), also confers a number of benefits[^For a well-referenced overview of cold exposure research check out [dr Rhonda Pattrick's cold stress report](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/cold-stress.pdf)].

| Effect | Stressor |
| ------ | -------- |
| Athletic endurance | Heat & cold |
| Increased lifespan[^In animal research and human models, it's all very experimental and not at all 100% proven] | Heat & cold |
| Heat shock protein production | Heat & cold |

| Muscle growth | Heat[^Cold when applied right after exercise actually reduces muscle growth gains] |
| Increased insulin sensitivity | Heat |
| Increased neurogenesis[^The creation of new neurons in the brain] | Heat |
| Improved cardiovascular function | Heat |
| Growth hormone release | Heat |
| Increases red blood cell count | Heat |

| Cold shock proteins | Cold |
| Reduced inflammation | Cold |
| White blood cell increase | Cold |
| Increased brown fat & thermogenesis | Cold |
