# Increase life and health span through hormesis

Your body is your most complex and valueble posession. It's anatomy is the result of billions of years of adaptation to complex, varying and hostile environments. You can't use language to tell your body to activate it's self-preservation mechanisms. Luckily, there are other ways.

**Principles for using hormesis**

**In this chapter**

## Hormesis is the activation of defences

The human body evolved in nature, which can be a very hostile environment. In order to survive as a species we've had to develop ways to deal with things like:

- Temperature exposure
- Starvation
- Strenuous muscle use
- Toxic chemicals in plants
- Radiation exposure (UV from the sun)

In order to deal with this the human body has a host of defense mechanisms. Because defense costs energy, these mechanisms are only activated when needed. For example, if we get bombarded with radiation (sun) we develop a shield of melanin pigment (tanning). We call this process of activating defenses _hormesis_.

Hormesis has 2 interesting properties:

1. It overcompensates
2. Mechanisms are generalised

The overcompensation means that a little of a stressor can cause a disproportionately strong defense. The generalised mechanisms means that the body doesn't have highly specific defenses but rather a handful of areas. For example, cold exposure and heat exposure both cause the body to make heat schock proteins.

Because of these two characteristics we can activate the body's defenses with harmless stimuli. These harmless stimuli are sometimes perceived as harmful, causing the body to strengthen itself. For example saunas (heat exposure) have been shown to decrease a number of disease risks. Likewise exercise (muscle stress) has many benefits. Drinking tea (a toxin) too can have benefits for health and longevity.
