# Calculating your money tree

The goal of your money tree is to generate money for you. There are 3 steps to building your tree:

1. Calculating the size
2. Growing the tree
3. Eating the fruits forever

For most people retiring on a money tree is feasible, especially if you start early.

## Calculating the size

There are three money amounts we will calculate what you need to reach:

1. Survive - meet your basic needs
2. Thrive - allow you to spend on fun
3. Freedom - let you live your perfect lifestyle

For each of these three we need to come to a specific number. No guessing allowed.

### Survival: not having to work

Your basic needs come down to food, shelter and obligations. Calculate your monthly cost and multiply by 12 to calculate what yearly income you need.

Things to keep in mind here:

- Rent
- Food
- Insurance
- Non optional costs

**Do not include fun** in here. The idea of your survival number is that you will not go into debt if you stop working. The survival level is not about retirement as such, having this amount will grant you certain perks like:

- No stress over not making rent
- Freedom to quit your job and take months finding your next
- All your income is now available for fun

Make this category as bare bones as possible.

> **Note on lean fi/re.** There are a class of people that calculate their financial goals not on where they live now, but on where they could live. For example living in Thailand is infinitely cheaper than New York City. I suggest calculating this amount based on where you *currently* live. You can always move.
