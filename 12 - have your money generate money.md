# Having your money make money

Investing is giving money now to get more later. Let's say I have 10 chickens that produce an egg a day each, which I can sell for €10 to my neighbours. That means I have a €10 daily income. This would equal 10*365 = €3650 a year.

You have €1000 available to invest. You offer to give me this €1000,- in return for 25% of my eggs (which would give you €2.50 every day).

> When you buy shares in a company, you are buying their future profits.

This would give you 2.50*365 = €912.50 every year. So after 2 years you would have €1825 which is a lot more that the €1000 you gave me. So why would I agree to trading your money for 25% of the profits? Well perhaps I:

1. Want to buy more chickens so I make even more money
2. I am short on cash and need money now rather than later
3. I took out a loan to buy the chickens, and want to pay it back

It's a silly example, but this is the basic mechanic of how the stock market operates.

# Individual stocks are risky, markets less so

Let's say we buy 5 of the 100 stocks of Acme Incorporated. This means we own 5% of the company and have a right to 5% of their profits every year.

So long as Acme does well we will gain 5/100 = 5% of their substantial profits. But what if Acme goes bankrupt? Then we lose it all... Instead of buying shares in a company, we can buy shares of an index fund.

> An index fund buys the top performing companies in a region/sector.

For example the S&P 500 index fund buys shares in 500 big and reliable companies on the US market. If you buy 1 share in the S&P 500 index you in essence own a small portion of 500 companies.

> An index fund like the S&P 500 is basically like betting on the 500 companies that have proven to generate profits.

Why is this good? If one of the companies fails, the other 499 are still up and running. You spread your risk across many ventures without having to manage a complex share portfolio. Examples of an index 'market' are:

- Big US companies (S&P 500)
- Smaller companies that look like they will grow (Vanguard Global Small Cap)
- Sustainable companies (Sustainable Europe Index Fund)
- Companies in healthcare (Vanguard Health Care Index Fund)

# You can also lend money to governments (bond index fund)

Bonds are loans. You offer the bond issuer money right now, and they promise to give you back a set amount later. Common bond issuers are governments and corporations.

> A government bond allows you to give a government money, and at the end of the term (e.g. a year) they give you back more.

So what if a government can't pay you back? It has happened before (Greece, Iceland etc) and will certainly happen again. You can buffer against this by buying an index of bonds.

A share of a bond index means you are investing small amounts in many bonds at the same time. If you invest in a bond index you are at less risk of a government failing to pay their debts.
