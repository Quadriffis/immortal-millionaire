## Sections

The book is separated into 4 sections:

1. Productivity & learning
2. Health & body recomposition
3. Finance & investment
4. My personal habits

## Structure of the chapters

Each chapter is written so as to have a 'how to ...' approach. Every chapter has 4 sections:

1. The principles in this chapter
2. What you can expect
3. Explanation of each principle
4. My personal story in learning

The information sections are written to contain actionable information.

How final sections contain personal stories explaining how I came to the realisations and skills that made me able to write the current section.
