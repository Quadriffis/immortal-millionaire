# How to read this book

Treat this book as a buffet. Find the things you like, consume them and skip what doesn't appeal to you. You are welcome to read this book front to back, back to front or in a random order. You may already know some things, and other chapters may open new worlds to you. Take your time and integrate things that appeal to you into your life.

## Sections

The book is separated into 4 sections:

1. Productivity & learning
2. Health & body recomposition
3. Finance & investment
4. My specific implementations of the information in this book

## Structure of the chapters

The chapters in the first 3 sections follow the same format. I am aware that this kind of pre-defined structure does not appeal to everyone. While some people prefer a more story based approach, I consider this book to be more of a manual than a storybook (though I tell my personal story as well). 

Each chapter is written so as to have a 'how to' approach. Every chapter has 5 sections:

1. The principles in this chapter
2. What you can expect in this chapter
3. Explanation of each principle
4. Getting started suggestions
5. My personal story in learning

## Taking notes

You are most likely reading this on a digital device, presumably an e-reader (kindle/kobo etc) or as a pdf on another device. Both of these options usually have highlighting and bookmarking capabilities. I recommend highlighting things you want to think about more later, and bookmarking pages you want to refer back to at a later point. View [this Kindle help page](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201241990), [this Kobo help page](https://www.kobo.com/help/en-US/article/3271/highlighting-text-on-your-kobo-ereader) or [this Adobe reader page](https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/mark-text-edits.html) for instructions on how to do that.

This book uses footnotes that look like this[^This is a footnote]. Depending on your device these will either render at the bottom of the page, at the end of the chapter or at the end of the book. It is important to know that you can click these footnotes, this will show you the content of the footnote. When at the footnotes you can simply click the arrow after the footnote content and you will be taken back to the part of the document where you clicked the footnote.
