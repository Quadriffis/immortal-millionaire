This is a book I've been meaning to write. In essence it compiles the things I wish I knew about health, productivity and finance earlier in life.

As you can see, everything is on Github under the "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives" license. This means you can read the whole book for free if you'd like. I will be selling user-friendly ebooks (epub, pdf) when I am happy with the final result.
