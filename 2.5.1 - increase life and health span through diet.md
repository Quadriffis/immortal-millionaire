# Increase life and health span through diet

Our experience of life is always through the lens of the body. Keeping the vessel we use to experience reality in shape is the ultimate investment. Like any machine our body was optimised to be used in certain ways, by respecting those we can increase the odds of living long and well.

**Principles of a longevity diet**

1. Take care of the basics first
2. Follow a longevity diet
3. Keep an eye on your blood values & compensate deficiencies
4. Consider taking supplements

## Take care of the basics first

Let's say your neighbour drives a car with a broken windshield. The came car has a squeaky door handle on the passenger side. Which do you think he should fix first?

In the example it's obviously the windshield. But when it comes to heath people are for some reason predisposed to reaching for supplements before fixing their basic lifestyle. Your body is not going to thank you for taking an experimental supplement if you are obese or out of shape.

## Longo's longevity diet

Lifespan appears to be a function of genetics and lifestyle. While we have no control over genetics (yet, looking at you crispr-cas[^A gene editing technique that could be used to fix genetic defects. See the [Crispr-cas wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)]) we do have control over our lifestyle. One of the major impacts is what we eat.

Remember that food is for humans what fuel is for cars. You would expect no good things from throwing diesel into a regular petrol/gasoline car. It is important for us to figure out what our body thrives on, and then makes sure it receives that.

It is near impossible to study to do a double-blind placebo controlled trial on humans for longevity diets. The study would likely be unethical and take at least one human lifetime. What we can do is:

1. Epidemiological studies (how long do people who smoke live? Can we draw conclusions?)
2. Animal studies (if it works on a worm, could it work on a human?)
3. Centenarian studies (how did the oldest humans live?)
4. Clinical studies (what can we learn about healthy living from treating diabetics?)

From the above we can identify strategies that are likely to increase our odds of a long and healthy life. According to the research compilation of doctor Valter Longo in his book [The Longevity Diet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35697130-the-longevity-diet) the general recommendations from the above sources seems to be:

- **Go loosely vegan/pescatarian** - prefer fish high in omega 3 and vitamin b12 but low in mercury. Examples include salmon, anchovies, sardines, cod, sea bream, trout, clams, shrimp.
- **Below the age of 65 keep protein intake low** - defined as 0.31-0.36 grams per pound of bodyweight, or the metric equivalent of 0.68-0.80 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. E.g. an 80kg/176lb person should consume around 60 grams of protein a day.
- **Above the age of 65 increase protein intake** - in increase of 10-20%. Centenarian studies find that the lower levels of growth related hormones need to be compensated for with slightly higher protein intake.
- **Consume complex carbohydrates** - from sources like vegetables, beans and legumes. Glycemic index and load are your guide here. A portion of lentils (150g) has a glycemic load of 5, whereas a portion of white rice (150g) has a glycemic load of 27. See [this list by Harvard University](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods).
- **Optimise the intake of healthy fats** - from sources like nuts and olive oil. Avoid trans fats, hydrogenated fats and saturated fats (in that order of priority).
- **Practice time-restricted eating** - see the hormesis section on fasting. Centenarians appear to eat 1-2 meals a day plus snacks within a span of 12 hours. Aim to eat nothing 3-4 hours before sleep.
- **Eat a diet high in a variety of nutrients** - most of the above will guide you to such a diet, but remember to make a conscious effort to eat a variety of foods. You may consider looking at the food patterns of your ancestors (within the confines of the above recommendations) to lightly optimise for your particular genes[^Fun fact, evolution is slow but visible. Historically heavy dairy consumers like the Netherlands have low incidence of lactose intolerance. Genetic pools like native Americans are quite reliably lactose intolerant or allergic.].

The above assumes you took care of the basics like obesity and deficiencies.

## Commentary on Longo's longevity diet

There are some caveats I'd like to point out that he above recommendations will be beneficial, but are most likely incomplete. Particularly, recommending low saturated fat intake regardless of source and recommending low protein intake regardless of source.

The fact is that the studies leading to the above conclusions are not double blind placebo controlled studies. That leads to potentially infinite confounding factors. For example, looking at a country like the United States (where a lot of research is done) you will see many secondary relationships like:

- People who eat a lot of saturated fat often do so from low quality food, they also tend to do less exercise and participate in a host of unhealthy behaviours
- Similarly a high protein diet can easily be an indicator of a diet rich in fast food, and thus likely high in glycemic index

What it comes down to is that the conclusions drawn from epidemiological studies are **unlikely to do harm and potentially do a lot of good**.

### Saturated fat

The recommendation to avoid saturated fats is one I expect to be altered in the coming years of research. The reason for this is that diets rich in saturated fats (think US diet) are often rich in other problematic ingredients like trans fats, sugars and low vegetable ingestion. Additionally not all saturated fats are the same with regards to health benefit or risk.

An early indication for this can be found in a paper that compared cardiovascular disease (CVD), all cause mortality (ACM) for different sources of saturated fat (SFA) consumption[^See [Dietary fat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in a population at high risk of cardiovascular disease](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283723416_Dietary_fat_intake_and_risk_of_cardiovascular_disease_and_all-cause_mortality_in_a_population_at_high_risk_of_cardiovascular_disease)]:

- Saturated fat intake showed an increased risk cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality
- Mono and poly unsaturated fats showed a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality

This seems to confirm commonly cited recommendations. However, saturated fat intake:

- From fish and nuts decreased cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality
- From processed meats increased cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality
- From dairy showed increases for cardiovascular disease, except for the highest consumption category where it was decreased
- From dairy showed decreased all cause mortality for the second lowest consumption category, but high risk for high consumers

In other words saturated fat is bad unless it comes from fish or nuts, or if you get it through low dairy consumption.

The above paints a confusing picture. What I mean to show with it is that things are more complicated than saturated vs unsaturated fats. The coming years of research will probably find that specific fats are beneficial or harmful as opposed to putting all saturated and unsaturated fats on the same pile.

### Protein intake

Similarly to saturated fat there are studies finding complexities in protein intake. For example a study on over half a million people showed[^See [Meat Intake and Mortality, A Prospective Study of Over Half a Million People](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/414881)]:

- Red meat increased all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer
- Processed meat increased all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer
- White meat **decreased** all cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and cancer (the effect was more pronounced in men)

Similarly fish (a high protein food) consumption has been shown reliably to decrease cardiovascular disease and all cause mortality. A study on a diabetic nurse population found a dose-dependent relationship between fish, where the highest benefit was shown in those who consumed fish more than 5 times per week[^See [Fish and Long-Chain ω-3 Fatty Acid Intake and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease and Total Mortality in Diabetic Women](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/107/14/1852)]. A meta analysis including 222,364 people found a similar 'more is better' relation for fish, at least for cardiovascular disease[^ See [Accumulated Evidence on Fish Consumption and Coronary Heart Disease Mortality](http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/109/22/2705)]. These studies are not perfect, but do point to a more complex system than 'less protein is better'. Similar results were found based on WHO and FAO data[^See [Fish Consumption and Mortality from All Causes, Ischemic HeartDisease, and Stroke: An Ecological Study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091743598904728)].

In general studies most studies find higher mortality for populations that consume high amounts of protein[^See [Low carbohydrate–high protein diet and mortality in a cohort of Swedish women](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2796.2007.01774.x/full), [Low carbohydrate-high protein diet and incidence of cardiovascular diseases in Swedish women: prospective cohort study](http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e4026), [Low-carbohydrate–high-protein diet and long-term survival in a general population cohort](https://www.nature.com/articles/1602557)]. Most studies point out though that these results seem to be primarily to animal protein consumption. Based on the aforementioned studies one might even hypothesise that if these studies would have split white meat, red meat, fish and vegetable protein sources the results would have been far more nuanced.

## Hybrid longevity diet

There are valid arguments to be made for a Longo style longevity diet, but in my opinion it lacks nuance. The recommendations will probably result in health benefits for most people who choose to adhere to all of the recommendations. Based on my own reading of the underlying research and other studies I follow a hybrid longevity diet that is likely to change as new information becomes available.

**Food intake**

- **Fats for energy** - I take the majority of my calories in the form of fats and most of my food volume as plants. The research I have read so far seems to support strategies of relying on fats or complex carbohydrates to maintain a low glycemic load diet. I have noticed that by the numbers I rely on fats for energy. A gigantic bowl of salad (half a kilo) with a shot glass of olive oil (50 grams) will supply about 150 kcal from the salad and 440 from the oil. Likewise a kilo of tomato will supply 180 kcal, and a large handful of nuts (100 grams) 600-700 kcal.
- **Fats by specific type** - the saturated/unsaturated divide may not be helpful in separating the health effects on humans. So far research is conflicting. A controversial study for example found that replacing saturated fats with a specific unsaturated one resulted in a _higher risk_ mortality[^See [Use of dietary linoleic acid for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and death: evaluation of recovered data from the Sydney Diet Heart Study and updated meta-analysis](http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.e8707)]. Combined with the studies above I try to eat oils with a documented positive effect.
	- **Olive oil** has been reasonably well documented to have positive health effects. It's major fatty acid content is oleic acid which seems to be beneficial. It is my oil of choice for non-cooking uses. I would like to stress that I recommend high quality oil (you should be able to drink it) since low quality oils are often fake and far less tasty.
	- **Coconut oil** is my oil of choice of cooking oil due to it's stability, high smoking point and shelf life. It is also high in medium chain triglycerides making it loved under those who aim for ketosis (see fasting section).
	- **Vegetable oils in general** I prefer to avoid based on the conflicting evidence of both the study in the first bullet and studies finding indications that certain vegetable oils can increase heart disease and cancer incidence[^See [Diet and disease--the Israeli paradox: possible dangers of a high omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid diet.](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/8960090) and [New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-50)]. That includes margarine products, especially for heated cooking. I specifically avoid oil high in the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid (not to be confused with alpha-linolenic acid which is an omega-3) as studies seem to indicate it has a particularly negative effect[^See [New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids](https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1741-7015-10-50)]. This excludes oils with a good research track record like olive.
	- **Animal fats** such as meat and dairy are traditionally thought of as bad due to their saturated fat content. Since saturated fats in recent research have not proven to be reliable predictors of health risks (when not combined with other unhealthy foods), I don't worry about them to much. I have shifted my consumption of meat away from beef due to the environmental impact but am nutritionally not against high quality unprocessed meat, that means yes to a good steak but no to fast food. Fats from fish are robustly documented to have a positive health impact so I have as much of those as I want
- **Protein quality vs quantity** - doctor Longo suggests a low intake of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight. I have taken his research as a reason to keep an eye on my protein intake, but don't obsess over the numbers. Like the studies in the Longo diet commentary suggest there are differences between protein sources and the studies he bases those conclusions on are all flawed in that they are not double blind placebo controlled studies. Still, choosing to eat more fish and vegetable proteins is unlikely to have a negative health effect, so I have a lot of fish and nuts.
- **Carbohydrates based on glycemic load** - I am not against carbohydrates as a rule but choose them based on the strain they put on my body. That means high glycemic load foods like fruit juices are a no, but vegetables, beans and legumes are fine. Based on those parameters I refrain from traditional staples like potatoes, rice and grain products (e.g. pasta, bread).
- **Vegetables** are a low risk and high gain proposition. A variety of them will supply a host of nutrients against a low glycemic load and calorie intake. When it comes to preferences I use glycemic load and index as an indicator. I exclude high-starch plants like potato from my consumption but consume high quantifies of greens.
- **No documented health risks** - some things are well documented to be negative: refined sugars, trans fats, hydrogenated fats.

**Food timing**

- **Time restricted eating** - I have been intermittent fasting for years and greatly enjoy it. Doctor Longo adds the extra dimension of having your eating window during the day due to keeping in sync with the circadian rhythm. I currently have a 8 hour eating window starting at noon.
- **Periodic multi-day fasting** - research on multi-day fasts and the fast mimicking diet is pretty incredible. I currently do a 5 day fast every 3 months. For the details on this approach see the fasting section later in this chapter.

## Blood values and deficiencies

Many people seem intent on using supplements blindly. It is in most developed countries however trivial to get a blood panel that tests for useful values.

Supplements should be exactly what the name implies, supplemental consumptions. They are not designed to replace a varied diet that supplies the nutrients your body needs. They can however offer ways to:

- Correct deficiencies
- Offer benefits that regular foods do not

Don't blindly take supplements:

1. Get your blood tested
2. Make a game plan (supplements/food)
3. Test again a few weeks later

Note however that blood tests are not like opening the door to a room to see what is inside. You can't just "test your blood" and expect a list of results to come back. You need to test for specific things. You can't just go by statistics, as they can be deceiving. If for example 50% of a population is deficient in vitamin B12, that might convince you to take the supplement. If the underlying data however shows that the 50% that has this issue is over 65 years old, you may or may not change your standpoint.

For each of the things you test for there is probably a different test that needs to be run on your blood. It is therefore vital to know what you want to test for. Also keep in mind that the unit of measurement sometimes differs per lab. If you are used to get your levels of a marker being something like 2.5 and suddenly they are 200, ask your doctor what unit the test was done in. Often They switched labs and went from one standard (e.g. mmol/L) to another (g/L). You can find conversion tools online, or can ask your doctor to help you standardise the results.

## Common deficiencies & what to test for

When it comes to blood tests, note that not all values are immediately useful. Cholesterol values for example are not all that useful for many young people. Having some baseline readings however can be valuable in future scenarios. There are a number of values that are interesting to test that are not per definition related to dietary deficiencies.

On a statistical basis there are a number of supplements that could benefit a great many people, and you should get yourself tested for the levels in your system. Depending on your location and environment it may pay off to do tests for things like heavy metals. Ask your doctor what values might be interesting for your particular situation, genetics and environment.

I recommend asking your doctor for the original lab notes of your tests and keeping a spreadsheet of your tested values. Often a doctor will only tell you 'everything looked fine' without sharing the actual values. This is perfectly normal since most people have no desire to know about the specifics. By asking for the lab for the original notes you can observe trends and when needed show the results to a specialist you might have to see in the future. My doctor usually has the assistant email me scanned copies of the lab note which I back up and record in a spreadsheet.

The following section discusses some commonly recommended tests.

### Iron

This is often associated with low energy levels. In fact the past year I've been perpetually frustrated by an advertisement in the London metro that recommends an iron rich drink for people who feel tired. While low iron can make you tired, being tired doesn't mean you have low iron.

In fact, excess iron can potentially cause a host of problems from cardiovascular disease to cancer[^See [Moderate elevation of body iron level and increased risk of cancer occurrence and death](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812813688_0045)]. There is a big difference of iron needs between the sexes as well, since women periodically lose iron through menstruation and men don't. Iron should be tested for, but never taken as a supplement unless a deficiency is found. Especially men should avoid multivitamins with iron in them.

When testing for iron you will likely be confronted with the following terms, which I'll explain in simplified terms:

- **Transferrin** is a protein used for iron transport in the blood. It transports iron from the intestines (food) to the cells. Serum iron is a measure for the amount of circulating iron that is bound to transferrin.
-  **Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)** is the amount of iron your body is capable of binding using transferrin.
- **Iron/transferrin saturation** is a measure of the amount of transferrin that is currently being used to hold iron.
- **Ferritin** is an iron storage (and to a lesser degree transport) protein that buffers against having harmful high or low levels or free iron. It is used as an indirect measure for the amount of iron in the body.
- **Hemoglobin (Hb)** is sometimes reported under iron tests and sometimes under hemotology

Proteins like transferrin and ferritin have more functions than described here (e.g. immune function) but for the sake or your iron test those are not essential to understand.

### Testosterone

Humans are sensitive to testosterone levels for a number of physical and mental issues. Low testosterone in both men and women can manifest as fatigue, depression, trouble concentrating and sexual dysfunction.

In a study of older men (50+) testosterone levels were correlated with increased risk of death, even when other factors like age, body fat and lifestyle were taken into account[^See [Low Serum Testosterone and Mortality in Older Men](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/93/1/68/2598158)]. Preliminary studies confirm that testosterone therapy in older men reduces the mortality effects of low testosterone[^See [Testosterone Treatment and Mortality in Men with Low Testosterone Levels](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/97/6/2050/2536693)]. A German study on females ages 18-75 also found that low testosterone was associated with increased all-cause mortality [^See [Low testosterone levels predict all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in women: a prospective cohort study in German primary care patients](http://www.eje-online.org/content/163/4/699.short)].

Low testosterone have been found to be associated with the well-being, mood and sexual function of both men[^See [Testosterone replacement therapy for hypogonadal men with SSRI-refractory depression](http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327\(97\)00168-7/abstract), [Bioavailable Testosterone and Depressed Mood in Older Men: The Rancho Bernardo Study](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/2/573/2864323) and [Testosterone and Depression in Aging Men](http://www.ajgponline.org/article/S1064-7481\(12\)61179-8/abstract)] as well as women[^See [Transdermal testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function in premenopausal women](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/2003/10050/Transdermal_testosterone_therapy_improves.4.aspx) and [The impact of testosterone imbalance on depression and women's health](http://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122\(02\)00013-0/abstract)], though in women abnormally high levels have been shown to be associated with depression as well.

### Homocysteine

Homocysteine is an amino acid that is not obtained through diet, it is an element the cycle that handles methionine and cysteine which are both amino acids as well. Converting homocysteine to methionine and cysteine depends heavily on vitamins B 2,6,12 and folate[^See the [Folate wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate#DNA_and_amino_acid_production) and [homocysteine wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine#Biosynthesis_of_cysteine)].

The data on homocysteine and health seems contradictive:

- **Cardiovascular risk** is higher for people with higher homocysteine levels[^See [Homocysteine and Familial Longevity: The Leiden Longevity Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017543) and (Plasma Homocysteine Levels and Mortality in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease)[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199707243370403]].
- **Cancer risk** is higher for people with elevated homocysteine levels[^See [Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for cancer and a new potential tumor marker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898102001742)].
- Lowering homocysteine directly by supplementing with folate **does not** seem to have benefits for cardiovascular or cancer risk[^See [Effects of Lowering Homocysteine Levels With B Vitamins on Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, and Cause-Specific Mortality](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/226081)]
- Randomised trials report positive effects for a combination of folate, B6 and B12 for those who have undergone certain cardiovascular surgeries[^See [Effect of Homocysteine-Lowering Therapy With Folic Acid, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B6 on Clinical Outcome After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195230)]
- Higher than RDA amounts of folate and B6 combined seem to reduce cardiovascular risk in women[^See [Folate and Vitamin B6 From Diet and Supplements in Relation to Risk of Coronary Heart Disease Among Women](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187209)]

So, elevated homocysteine predicts issues. Lowering homocysteine seems to not do much. Based on that data there are a number of possible conclusions:

- Elevated homocysteine is the symptom of an (unknown) underlying problem
- The research done is not using the right typed/doses of vitamins

Either way, until better research is done getting your homocysteine tested is interesting as a health indicator even if we're not sure how to fix it if it's high.

#### The MTHFR gene

There is a particular gene that is important for the processing of homocysteine through the folate cycle. This gene is called "Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase" or MTHFR for short. There are a number of versions of this gene in humans. If you have a variant called 677TT you will have severely reduced activity if the MTHFR enzyme which results in elevated homocysteine levels. Mutations in this gene potentially increase the risk of  schizophrenia[^See [Meta-Analysis of All Published SZ Association Studies (Case-Control Only) rs1801133](https://www.webcitation.org/66LAg9Kuk?url=http://www.szgene.org/meta.asp?geneID=4)], dementia[^See [Apolipoprotein E, Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) Mutation and the Risk of Senile Dementia -An Epidemiological Study Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Method](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jea1991/10/3/10_3_163/_article)] and myocardial infarction[^See [C667T and A1298C polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene and susceptibility to myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis](http://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/article/S0167-5273\(16\)30889-0/fulltext)].

### Lipid panel (cholesterol etc)

A lipid panel tests cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The understanding of science has changed quite a bit in the past years. Particularly with regards to cholesterol. The first important thing to understand is that the body relies greatly on fats and cholesterol for optimal function. The human brain is almost 60% fats (excluding water)[^See [Essential fatty acids and human brain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20329590)] and contains a lot of cholesterol as well. Cholesterol makes up about 30% of our cell membranes to keep them fluid (read: flexible)[^See [the cholesterol wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol#Function)]. The second important thing is that when a doctor talks about your cholesterol they are not talking about the cholesterol as you find it in food. In the blood cholesterol exists mostly incorporated into larger complexes like LDL and HDL.

Your test will probably come back with the following categories:

- **Total cholesterol** - this value reflects your absolute cholesterol levels and does not make a distinction between types. Lower is not better! Indiscriminately demonising cholesterol is a grave mistake on our society's part, low cholesterol is for example a factor for having _more_ heart failure Low serum total cholesterol is associated with marked increase in mortality in advanced heart failure[^See [Low serum total cholesterol is associated with marked increase in mortality in advanced heart failure](http://www.onlinejcf.com/article/S1071-9164\(02\)00018-0/abstract)].
- **LDL** - or Low Density Lipoprotein is a combination of fats, protein and cholesterol. It is a vehicle in the blood used to transport fats and cholesterol to cells that need them. The 'low' in LDL refers to is being less dense and more 'fluffy' if you will. There are many classes of LDL like ultra/very/intermediate/low density lipoprotein (respectively ULDL, vLDL, IDL, LDL). While research on these types is being done plenty, most countries still bunch them together on the same pile (LDL) when it comes to the medical system.
- **HDL** - or High Density Lipoprotein is similar to LDL but are more dense (less 'fluffy'). Where LDL transports fats and cholesterol _to_ cells HDL transports it _away_ from cells. Together they form the supply and drainage of lipids and cholesterol. HDL is often called 'good' cholesterol since people with excess LDL need HDL to balance it out, this is obviously inaccurate since balancing two things doesn't mean one is good or bad.
- **Triglycerides** - are what is colloquial speech we call fats. Olive oil is mostly triglycerides and your body stores fat as triglycerides. On a biochemical level they are a head of glycerol with three tails of fatty acids.
- **Total:HDL ratio** - this is a measure of how much HDL there is in the blood relative to other cholesterol types. It is far more predictive of mortality risk than absolute cholesterol or LDL numbers. So far it appears to be the best simple lipid based marker we have[^See [Importance of LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio as a predictor for coronary heart disease events in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: a 15-year follow-up](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1185/0300799039117034) and [Association of Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Cholesterol/ HDL and Triglyceride with All-Cause Mortality in Life Insurance Applicants](https://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/20666103)].

What should you do it any of these markers are out of whack? First, listen to your doctor of course. But equally important is to follow recent science. As a general rule the following are true:

- Eating saturated fats is not per se a risk factor for cardiovascular disease
- Eating cholesterol is not per se a risk factor for cardiovascular disease
- Eating low glycemic index/load foods (especially sugars) is

If you want to know why many countries still believe a low fat and low cholesterol diet prevents cardiovascular disease please read [my summary on the history of cholesterol research](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/history-of-cholesterol-research/) or watch [this excellent 80 minute presentation](https://peterattiamd.com/how-did-we-come-to-believe-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-are-bad-for-us/) on it by dr Peter Attia. If you like deep science, look at this [in depth blog series](https://peterattiamd.com/the-straight-dope-on-cholesterol-part-i/) he wrote.

### Complete blood count

The complete blood count (CBC) checks the levels of a number of blood cells, proteins and other values. It is a generalised test often used as a general health check. By looking at the different types of cells (e.g. red, white, platelets) and markers (e.g. hemoglobin) in the blood your doctor can estimate the overall functions of a large number of systems. Rather than being a specific diagnosis if something in this panel is off your doctor will probably suggest more targeted tests to find out what is wrong.

### Vitamin D

Vitamin d is a steroid hormone. That is to say that this substance has the ability to reach the cell nucleus (where the DNA is kept) and influence what genes are expressed. In other words: vitamin d changes what part of your DNA is on and off.

Humans have two main sources of vitamin d:

- Food
- The sun

Foods high in vitamin d include for example fatty fish. One stereotypical example is cod liver oil.

Our skin is able to generate vitamin d from sunlight as well. The problem there is that in the recent parts of human existence we've spent a lot of time indoors and covering 90% of our skin surface area with sun blocking clothing.

Some common reasons for low vitamin d levels include:

- Sitting inside all day
- Having darker skin in countries with less sun
- Wearing clothing that covers a lot of skin

The effects of low vitamin d can be manifold (remember, it affects DNA expression):

- Lower mood levels
- Suboptimal immune function
- Suboptimal cognitive function
- Weaker bone and teeth

### Magnesium

This mineral is used in a large amount of functions ranging from the immune system to the brain. It's used by 300+ enzymes and without it our primary ATP based cellular energy system would not function. 

There are no international population wide statistics on magnesium levels in the blood, but depending on what study you look at as many as 60% to 80% of people are deficient in magnesium.

There are a number of issues for many people:

> Many people don't consume enough magnesium and magnesium supplements are often bad

The issue with magnesium supplements is that different types are absorbed better or worse. Not only that, but it appears that different types are preferred by certain organs.

The important magnesium types to know:

| Type | Bioavailability | Notes |
| --- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Magnesium Oxide | Extremely low | Basically magnesium rust, can cause diarrhoea. |
| Magnesium Citrate | Good | Cost effective, mild laxative in higher dosages. |
| Magnesium Gluconate & Glycinate | Good | Harder to find, more expensive. Unpleasant taste in powder form. |
| Magnesium Lactate | Excellent  | Harder to find, dissolves well into liquids. I like it in tea. |

You can check for the type of magnesium in your supplement by checking the ingredient list.

### The harm of supplements

Vitamin supplements are not without risk. Many people approach it with a "worst case it doesn't do anything" attitude. The thing is that excess vitamins too can upset the balance of your body.

The B vitamin group for example is well known to stimulate certain types of growth. This is why people take it to make nails and hair grow faster/stronger. Hypothetically however these supplements could also provide valuable fuel for tumours.

Likewise for many male consumers taking extra iron is a terrible idea and has shown to increase risk for some disease, whereas this is less so the case for women (who lose iron through menstruation).

> Don't get me wrong: no supplement is inherently good or bad

Blindly taking highly concentrated supplements is a terrible idea though. Test yourself first.

### Interesting supplements

There are a number of supplements that have the potential to support a good quality of life, or to extend lifespan potentially. Many of these are quite experimental and have only proven to work in theory or on animal models.

#### Lithium Ororate

Lithium is associated in high dosages with the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is however in low dosages an essential mineral for optimal health. It occurs naturally in low dosages (up to 0.170 mg/L in tap water). The argument has been made in a New York Times article [should we all take a bit of lithium?](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/opinion/Sunday/should-we-all-take-a-bit-of-lithium.html) that we could all benefit from a low dosage of lithium on a daily basis.

While large therapeutic dosages are classified as medicine (and rightfully so) the smaller dosed supplements are available for purchase from many supplement vendors. The dosages are greatly smaller than those in the medicinal form.

#### Collagen

The human skin is kept in shape by a scaffold made of a protein structure called collagen. This part of the 'extracellular matrix' gives skin elasticity and keeps it from wrinkling. Damage to the collagen structure is done by UVA radiation, which causes wrinkles. This is why dermatologists hammer on using sunscreen all day every day.

While preventing damage by means of sunscreen is good advice, is doesn't help your body to repair damage that is bound to occur because of daily sun exposure.

> Note that sun exposure is positive for many health factors, the downside to the positive effects is skin aging.

Intuitively it makes sense that if a certain structure in the body breaks down (collagen) you can stimulate growth by consuming more building blocks (in the form of said collagen). While the body is very cabable of constructing collagen from other protein sources, consuming collagen as such seems to have positive effects on skin elasticity.

Studies have shown that radioactively labelled collagen (it's a harmless kind of study) can be traced to places in the body where collagen is present. A small placebo controlled study found that indeed consuming collagen increases skin elasticity after a few weeks.

Note that those looking to supplement collagen don't have to put up with dissolving regular collagen into hot water and drink a foul smelling mixture. There are great hydrolysed collagen supplements on the market that smell quite neutral and dissolve in cold water.

#### Metformin

Originally a diabetes drug, this compound has shown promise in the field of life extension. It gained popularity in recent years, especially in places like silicon valley where self-experimentation is quite widespread.

Depending on your country this compound may or may not be available for sale without prescription. Regardless of availability it is advisable to consult a medical professional before choosing to take a compound with strong effects like metformin.

#### Rapamicin

Named after Rapanui (easter island) this compound has stayed in the shadows for a large number of years. Research seems to indicate that through effects on the FOXO and mTor pathways this compound increases longevity.

The research on humans however is not very extensive and the availability is low as of the time of writing. It is not a common drug or supplement and is considered experimental.

#### Adaptogens

The class of adaptogens is a group of supplements that balances stress and relaxation responses. In essence these compounds give energy for those who are low on it and provide relaxation to those who are stressed.

This may sound conflicting, but it makes sense when viewed through the lens that adaptogens work at restoring a baseline. Instead of a substance that per definition causes a dose-dependent effect in a predictable direction (e.g. alcohol) they restore balance to functions that are out of whack.

The exact mechanisms differ per supplement, and for some the exact mechanisms are not known. For many though the adaptogenic effect has been robustly documented.

Interesting adaptogens include:

- Panax Ginseng root
- Reishi mushroom extracts
- Rhodiola

Depending on your geographical location some are easier to find than others.

#### Fish oil (omega 3's)

Fish oil is known as a beneficial supplement in pop culture. The effects that are often touted include their beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system and cholesterol levels. More and more research however seems to indicate that omega 3 fatty acids also have many benefits for neurological attributes like cognitive function and mood levels.

For this supplement it is important to realise that fatty acids are essential for the structure and functioning of cells. In essence human cells are bags of water, filled with molecular machinery (DNA, mitochondria etc). The 'bag' that is the border of the cell basically uses lipids as an important building block. The right lipids keep the cell membrane flexible and functioning optimally. This is very important for many things, including nerve function.

On supplement bottles you will often find references to EPA and DHA. These are two forms of omega 3 fatty acids. Their structure differs and research indicates that their effect differs as well.

If you plan to take fish oil on a long term basis make sure that you choose a reputable supplement that is adequately purified. The fish used to produce the oil may contain toxins like heavy metals (especially if the source fish is high up the food chain) that need to be filtered out.

With regards to toxins and oil quality it pays off to look for products that:

- Are produced from animals low on the food chain (e.g. herring instead of salmon)
- Are filtered well (everybody claims this so it is harder to test)
- Has lab tests available on their website

**Recommendations for supplements:**

Note: For all deficiencies ask your doctor if there is a reason you would have lower levels due to a reason other that low intake. B12 levels can also for example be low due to malabsorption.

| Supplement | Recommendation |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Vitamin D | When far from 75nmol/L or 30ng/ml[^See [Optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels for multiple health outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207384)] supplement with at least 800IU/day[^Equals 20 micrograms] |
| Vitamin B12 | Supplement or increase dietary intake of animal products, specifically liver and meat[^It's also found in eggs, but humans only absorb about 9%. See [Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959839)] |
| Magnesium | Prefer citrate, chelate and glycinate over magnesium oxide[^The magnesium type is on the bottle, just look at the ingredient section] |

## How university turned me into a lab rat

My bachelors degree turned out to be a double blessing. Not only did I get to explore human biology through curriculum, but many classes required me to write research papers on a topic of my choice.

It took some convincing in some cases, but in many cases I could use these papers to dive deeper into subjects that interested me. One pivotal moment was a metabolism paper I wrote called "Resveratrol bioavailability and Action". It was by no means a masterpiece, but triggered the interesting notion that the human body has built in mechanisms that increase lifespan.

You see, resveratrol was at the time considered a promising life extension compound. It's a powerful antioxidant that influences gene expression. It seemed to:

- Protect against cancer
- Activate the SIRT1 gene group who's equivalent extends life in other organisms
- Buffer the effects of high cholesterol

It turns out that resveratrol supplementation in humans is not all that effective since our liver metabolises it very quickly.

Nonetheless my interest was piqued. The SIRT1 gene group spoke to my imagination. Specifically the idea that the human body is capable of extending it's lifespan if we take the right steps in our lifestyle.

This lead me to an interest into epigenetics, the study of how the environment influences gene expression. One important thing to understand here is that genes are not a blueprint for the human body in the way that pop-culture sometimes presents it.

Human genes are an if-this-then-that system. If a certain stimulus is given human cells are programmed to respons in a certain way. For example (simplified):

- Sunlight > activate melanin genes > darker skin
- Vitamin d > influences hundreds of genes > changes in bone, mood, immune system etc

I felt like I had discovered something magical. After hearing my entire life that genes are a static blueprint that make my body what it is, I now knew that my genes are just a large repository of potential outcomes.

While resveratrol seemed to be a bust, my interest into longevity was piqued. Specifically, many studies seemed to talk about insulin when talking about longevity. Even resveratrol had a close link to insulin and related measures. A later paper I wrote called "The role of insulin in fasting metabolism and gene expression" was my first touchpoint with what I would later learn to call intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.

During the researching of this paper I found some things I at the time called counterintuitive, for example:

- Fasting increases growth hormone levels
- The body is perfectly capable of producing glucose without eating carbohydrates (or anything for that matter)
- Fasting periodically has similar benefits to limiting food consumption
- Fasting is good for the brain

In that particular paper I learned the basics of FoxO and mTor functions and how they relate to fasting and longevity.

As much as I enjoyed the rabbit hole of academic research, I'm a practically inclined person. After handing in this paper I started a regime of 16 hours of fasting a day. I expected to find it very hard to do, but actually thrived on this approach.

Since I had formulated some strict rules for myself as to what I do and do not eat, keeping myself fed throughout the day was a bit of a challenge. Not having to worry about food for the majority of the day was incredibly freeing! Not only that, but my mental and physical energy levels increased during the times I didn't eat.

Throughout my university years I started more and more to research longevity and unconventional lifestyles to optimise the body. After the first two years of study I had converted myself to:

- Intermittent fasting
- Sauna sessions 5+ times a week
- Low carb leaning to ketogenic diet

I also continued to experiment with:

- Cognitive enhancement supplements & practices
- Alternative sleep cycles

Through the years of experimentation I learned to separate fact from fiction. Since then words like intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet have become pop culture. It's the first time I've been a hipster, I did it before it was cool. While my post-university years were when I refined a lot of my protocols and theories, the basis for all of it has been my years in the academic world.

My experiments do not turn into dogma. As new information becomes available I adapt. My goal is to make the best decisions based on the information I have at the time. My most recent change was to incorporate a larger portion of complex carbohydrates into my diet based on the longevity studies of dr Longo.

I continue to read, experiment and refine my lifestyle. Some people say it sounds exhausting, I say it sounds exciting.
