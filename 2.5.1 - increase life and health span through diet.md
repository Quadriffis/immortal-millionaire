# Increase life and health span through diet

Our experience of life is always through the lens of the body. Keeping the vessel we use to experience reality in shape is the ultimate investment. Like any machine our body was optimised to be used in certain ways, by respecting those we can increase the odds of living long and well.

**Principles of a longevity diet**

1. Take care of the basics first
2. Follow a longevity diet
3. Keep an eye on your blood values & compensate deficiencies
4. Consider taking supplements

## Take care of the basics first

Let's say your neighbour drives a car with a broken windshield. The came car has a squeaky door handle on the passenger side. Which do you think he should fix first?

In the example it's obviously the windshield. But when it comes to heath people are for some reason predisposed to reaching for supplements before fixing their basic lifestyle. Your body is not going to thank you for taking an experimental supplement if you are obese or out of shape.

## Longevity diet

Lifespan appears to be a function of genetics and lifestyle. While we have no control over genetics (yet, looking at you crispr-cas[^A gene editing technique that could be used to fix genetic defects. See the [Crispr-cas wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR)]) we do have control over our lifestyle. One of the major impacts is what we eat.

We previously compared food to fuel for cars. You would expect no good things from throwing diesel into a regular petrol/gasoline car. It is important for us to figure out what our body thrives on, and then makes sure it receives that.

It is near impossible to study to do a double-blind placebo controlled trial on humans for longevity diets. The study would lilely be unethical and take at least one human lifetime. What we can do is:

1. Epedemiological studies (how long do people who smoke live? Can we draw conslusions?)
2. Animal studies (if it works on a worm, could it work on a human?)
3. Centenarian studies (how did the oldest humans live?)
4. Clinical studies (what can we learn about healthy living from treating diabetics?)

From the above we can draw conslusions about what is likely to increase our odds of a long and healthy life. The general recommendations from the above sources seems to be[^According to the research compilation of dr Valter Longo in his book [The Longevity Diet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35697130-the-longevity-diet)]:

- **Go loosely vegan/pescetarian** - prefer fish high in omega 3 and vitamin b12 but low in mercury. Examples include salmon, anchovies, sardinesm cod, sea bream, trouw, clams, shrimp.
- **Below the age of 65 keep protein intake low** - defined as 0.31-0.36 grams per pound of bodyweight, or the metric equivalent of 0.68-0.78 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. E.g. an 80kg/176lb person should consume around 60 grams of protein a day.
- **Above the age of 65 increase protein intake** - in increase of 10-20%. Centenarian studies find that the lower levels of growth related hormones need to be conpensated for with slightly higher protein intake.
- **Consume complex carbohydrates** - from sources like vegetables, beans and legumes. Glycemic index and load are your guide here. A portion of lentils (150g) has a glycemic load of 5, whereas a portion of white rice (150g) has a glycemic load of 27. See [this list by Harvard University](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic-index-and-glycemic-load-for-100-foods).
- **Optimise the intake of healthy fats** - from sources like nuts and olive oil. Avoid trans fats, hydrogenated fats and saturaled fats (in that order of priority).
- **Practice time-restricted eating** - see the hormesis section on fasting. Centenarials appear to eat 1-2 meals a day plus snacks within a span of 12 hours. Aim to eat nothing 3-4 hours before sleep.
- **Eat a diet high in a variety of nutrients** - most of the above will guide you to such a diet, but remember to make a conscious effort to eat a variety of foods. You may consider looking at the food patterns of your ancestors (within the confines of the above recommendations) to lightly optimise for your particular genes[^Fun fact, evolution is slow but visible. Historically heavy dairy consumers like the Netherlands have low incidence of lastose intolerance. Genetic pools like native Americans are quire reliably lactive intolerant or allergic.].

The above assumes you took care of the basics like obesity and deficiencies.

### Commentary on the longevity diet

While the recommendations are good, there are some caveats I'd like to point out that he above recommendations will be beneficial, but are most likely incomplete.

For example the recommendation to avoid saturated fats is one I expect to be altered in the coming years of research. The reason for this is that diets rich in saturated fats (think US diet) are often rich in other problematic ingredients like trans fats, sugars and low vegatable ingestion. Additionally not all saturated fats are the same with regards to health benefit or risk.

An early indication for this can be found in a paper that compared cardiovascular disease (CVD), all cause mortality (ACM) for different sources of saturated fat (SFA) consumption[^See [Dietary fat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in a population at high risk of cardiovascular disease](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283723416_Dietary_fat_intake_and_risk_of_cardiovascular_disease_and_all-cause_mortality_in_a_population_at_high_risk_of_cardiovascular_disease)]:

- SFA showed in increased risk CVD and ACM
- Mono and poly unsaturated fats showed a decreased risk for CVD and ACM

This seems to confirm commonly cited recommendations. However:

- SFA from fish and nuts decreased CVD and ACM
- SFA from processed meats increased CVD and ACM
- SFA from dairy showed increases for CVD, except for the highest consumption category where it was decreased
- SFA from dairy showed decreaed ACM for the second lowest consumption category, but high risk for high consumers

The above paints a confusing picture. What I mean to show with it is that things are more complicated than saturated vs unsaturated fats. The coming years of research will probably find that specific fats are beneficial or harmful as opposed to putting all saturated and unsaturated fats on the same pile.

I have personally implemented the longevity diet recommendations as:

- Eat low glycemic load foods (e.g. vegetables and lentils but not potatoes)
- Eat the majority of food volume as vegetables
- Aim for 0.8 grams of protein per kilo of bodyweight
- Eat fish and seafood instead of meat (though still sometimes meat)
- Implement time restricted eating of 8-10 hours (previously under 8 hours)
- Investigate the food patterns of my grandparents

I also periodically use the fast mimicking diet recommended in the same book, see the next chapter on details.

## Blood values and deficiencies

Many people seem intent on using supplements blindly. It is in most developed countries however trivial to get a blood panel that tests for useful values.

Supplements should be exactly what the name implies, supplemental consumptions. They are not designed to replace a varied diet that supplies the nutrients your body needs. They can however offer ways to:

- correct deficiencies
- offer benefits that regular foods do not

Don't blindly take supplements:

1. Get your blood tested
2. Make a game plan (supplements/food)
3. Test again a few weeks later

Note however that blood tests are not like opening the door to a room to see what is inside. You can't just "test your blood" and expect a list of results to come back. You need to test for specific things.

For each of the things you test for there is probably a different test that needs to be run on your blood. It is therefore vital to know what you want to test for.

Note that statistics can be deceiving. If for example 50% of a population is deficient in vitamin B12, that might convince you to take the supplement. If the underlying data however shows that the 50% that has this issue is over 65 years old, you may or may not change your standpoint.

On a statistical basis there are a number of supplements that could benefit a great many people:

- Vitamin d
- Vitamin B12
- Magnesium

Some values are useful simply to have a baseline of your usual values, these include:

- Iron
- Lipid panel (cholesterol etc)
- Certain hormones

Depending on your location and environment it may pay off to do tests for things like heavy metals.

Note that not all values have immediate value. Cholesterol values for example are not all that useful for many young people. Having some baseline readings however can be valuable in future scenarios.

### Vitamin D

Vitamin d is a steroid hormone. That is to say that this substance has the ability to reach the cell nucleus (where the DNA is kept) and influence what genes are expressed. In other words: vitamin d changes what part of your DNA is on and off.

Humans have two main sources of vitamin d:

- Food
- The sun

Foods high in vitamin d include for example fatty fish. One stereotypical example is cod liver oil.

Our skin is able to generate vitamin d from sunlight as well. The problem there is that in the recent parts of human existence we've spent a lot of time indoors and covering 90% of our skin surface area with sun blocking clothing.

Some common reasons for low vitamin d levels include:

- Sitting inside all day
- Having darker skin in countries with less sun
- Wearing clothing that covers a lot of skin

The effects of low vitamin d can be manifold (remember, it affects DNA expression):

- Lower mood levels
- Suboptimal immune function
- Suboptimal cognitive function
- Weaker bone and teeth

### Magnesium

This mineral is used in a large amount of functions ranging from the immune system to the brain. It's used by 300+ enzymes and without it our primary ATP based cellular energy system would not function. 

There are no international population wide statistics on magnesium levels in the blood, but depending on what study you look at as many as 60% to 80% of people are deficient in magnesium.

There are a number of issues for many people:

> Many people don't consume enough magnesium and magnesium supplements are often bad

The issue with magnesium supplements is that different types are absorbed better or worse. Not only that, but it appears that different types are preferred by certain organs.

The important magnesium types to know:

| Type | Bioavailability | Notes |
| --- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Magnesium Oxide | Extremely low | Basically magnesium rust, can cause diarrhoea. |
| Magnesium Citrate | Good | Cost effective, mild laxative in higher dosages. |
| Magnesium Gluconate & Glycinate | Good | Harder to find, more expensive. Unpleasant taste in powder form. |
| Magnesium Lactate | Excellent  | Harder to find, dissolves well into liquids. I like it in tea. |


You can check for the type of magnesium in your supplement by checking the ingredient list.

### The harm of supplements

Vitamin supplements are not without risk. Many people approach it with a "worst case it doesn't do anything" attitude. The thing is that excess vitamins too can upset the balance of your body.

The B vitamin group for example is well known to stimulate certain types of growth. This is why people take it to make nails and hair grow faster/stronger. Hypothetically however these supplements could also provide valuable fuel for tumours.

Likewise for many male consumers taking extra iron is a terrible idea and has shown to increase risk for some disease, whereas this is less so the case for women (who lose iron through menstruation).

> Don't get me wrong: no supplement is inherently good or bad

Blindly taking highly concentrated supplements is a terrible idea though. Test yourself first.

### Interesting supplements

There are a number of supplements that have the potential to support a good quality of life, or to extend lifespan potentially. Many of these are quite experimental and have only proven to work in theory or on animal models.

#### Lithium Ororate

Lithium is associated in high dosages with the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is however in low dosages an essential mineral for optimal health. It occurs naturally in low dosages (up to 0.170 mg/L in tap water). The argument has been made in a New York Times article [should we all take a bit of lithium?](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/opinion/Sunday/should-we-all-take-a-bit-of-lithium.html) that we could all benefit from a low dosage of lithium on a daily basis.

While large therapeutic dosages are classified as medicine (and rightfully so) the smaller dosed supplements are available for purchase from many supplement vendors. The dosages are greatly smaller than those in the medicinal form.

#### Collagen

The human skin is kept in shape by a scaffold made of a protein structure called collagen. This part of the 'extracellular matrix' gives skin elasticity and keeps it from wrinkling. Damage to the collagen structure is done by UVA radiation, which causes wrinkles. This is why dermatologists hammer on using sunscreen all day every day.

While preventing damage by means of sunscreen is good advice, is doesn't help your body to repair damage that is bound to occur because of daily sun exposure.

> Note that sun exposure is positive for many health factors, the downside to the positive effects is skin aging.

Intuitively it makes sense that if a certain structure in the body breaks down (collagen) you can stimulate growth by consuming more building blocks (in the form of said collagen). While the body is very cabable of constructing collagen from other protein sources, consuming collagen as such seems to have positive effects on skin elasticity.

Studies have shown that radioactively labelled collagen (it's a harmless kind of study) can be traced to places in the body where collagen is present. A small placebo controlled study found that indeed consuming collagen increases skin elasticity after a few weeks.

Note that those looking to supplement collagen don't have to put up with dissolving regular collagen into hot water and drink a foul smelling mixture. There are great hydrolysed collagen supplements on the market that smell quite neutral and dissolve in cold water.

#### Metformin

Originally a diabetes drug, this compound has shown promise in the field of life extension. It gained popularity in recent years, especially in places like silicon valley where self-experimentation is quite widespread.

Depending on your country this compound may or may not be available for sale without prescription. Regardless of availability it is advisable to consult a medical professional before choosing to take a compound with strong effects like metformin.

#### Rapamicin

Named after Rapanui (easter island) this compound has stayed in the shadows for a large number of years. Research seems to indicate that through effects on the FOXO and mTor pathways this compound increases longevity.

The research on humans however is not very extensive and the availability is low as of the time of writing. It is not a common drug or supplement and is considered experimental.

#### Adaptogens

The class of adaptogens is a group of supplements that balances stress and relaxation responses. In essence these compounds give energy for those who are low on it and provide relaxation to those who are stressed.

This may sound conflicting, but it makes sense when viewed through the lens that adaptogens work at restoring a baseline. Instead of a substance that per definition causes a dose-dependent effect in a predictable direction (e.g. alcohol) they restore balance to functions that are out of whack.

The exact mechanisms differ per supplement, and for some the exact mechanisms are not known. For many though the adaptogenic effect has been robustly documented.

Interesting adaptogens include:

- Panax Ginseng root
- Reishi mushroom extracts
- Rhodiola

Depending on your geographical location some are easier to find than others.

#### Fish oil (omega 3's)

Fish oil is known as a beneficial supplement in pop culture. The effects that are often touted include their beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system and cholesterol levels. More and more research however seems to indicate that omega 3 fatty acids also have many benefits for neurological attributes like cognitive function and mood levels.

For this supplement it is important to realise that fatty acids are essential for the structure and functioning of cells. In essence human cells are bags of water, filled with molecular machinery (DNA, mitochondria etc). The 'bag' that is the border of the cell basically uses lipids as an important building block. The right lipids keep the cell membrane flexible and functioning optimally. This is very important for many things, including nerve function.

On supplement bottles you will often find references to EPA and DHA. These are two forms of omega 3 fatty acids. Their structure differs and research indicates that their effect differs as well.

If you plan to take fish oil on a long term basis make sure that you choose a reputable supplement that is adequately purified. The fish used to produce the oil may contain toxins like heavy metals (especially if the source fish is high up the food chain) that need to be filtered out.

With regards to toxins and oil quality it pays off to look for products that:

- Are produced from animals low on the food chain (e.g. herring instead of salmon)
- Are filtered well (everybody claims this so it is harder to test)
- Has lab tests available on their website

**Recommendations for supplements:**

Note: For all deficiencies ask your doctor if there is a reason you would have lower levels due to a reason other that low intake. B12 levels can also for example be low due to malabsorption.

| Supplement | Recommendation |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Vitamin D | When far from 75nmol/L or 30ng/ml[^See [Optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels for multiple health outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207384)] supplement with at least 800IU/day[^Equals 20 micrograms] |
| Vitamin B12 | Supplement or increase dietary intake of animal products, specifically liver and meat[^It's also found in eggs, but humans only absorb about 9%. See [Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959839)] |
| Magnesium | Prefer citrate, chelate and glycinate over magnesium oxide[^The magnesium type is on the bottle, just look at the ingredient section] |

## How university turned me into a lab rat

My bachelors degree turned out to be a double blessing. Not only did I get to explore human biology through curriculum, but many classes required me to write research papers on a topic of my choice.

It took some convincing in some cases, but in many cases I could use these papers to dive deeper into subjects that interested me. One pivotal moment was a metabolism paper I wrote called "Resveratrol bioavailability and Action". It was by no means a masterpiece, but triggered the interesting notion that the human body has built in mechanisms that increase lifespan.

You see, resveratrol was at the time considered a promising life extension compound. It's a powerful antioxidant that influences gene expression. It seemed to:

- Protect against cancer
- Activate the SIRT1 gene group who's equivalent extends life in other organisms
- Buffer the effects of high cholesterol

It turns out that resveratrol supplementation in humans is not all that effective since our liver metabolises it very quickly.

Nonetheless my interest was piqued. The SIRT1 gene group spoke to my imagination. Specifically the idea that the human body is capable of extending it's lifespan if we take the right steps in our lifestyle.

This lead me to an interest into epigenetics, the study of how the environment influences gene expression. One important thing to understand here is that genes are not a blueprint for the human body in the way that pop-culture sometimes presents it.

Human genes are an if-this-then-that system. If a certain stimulus is given human cells are programmed to respons in a certain way. For example (simplified):

- Sunlight > activate melanin genes > darker skin
- Vitamin d > influences hundreds of genes > changes in bone, mood, immune system etc

I felt like I had discovered something magical. After hearing my entire life that genes are a static blueprint that make my body what it is, I now knew that my genes are just a large repository of potential outcomes.

While resveratrol seemed to be a bust, my interest into longevity was piqued. Specifically, many studies seemed to talk about insulin when talking about longevity. Even resveratrol had a close link to insulin and related measures. A later paper I wrote called "The role of insulin in fasting metabolism and gene expression" was my first touchpoint with what I would later learn to call intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.

During the researching of this paper I found some things I at the time called counterintuitive, for example:

- Fasting increases growth hormone levels
- The body is perfectly capable of producing glucose without eating carbohydrates (or anything for that matter)
- Fasting periodically has similar benefits to limiting food consumption
- Fasting is good for the brain

In that particular paper I learned the basics of FoxO and mTor functions and how they relate to fasting and longevity.

As much as I enjoyed the rabbit hole of academic research, I'm a practically inclined person. After handing in this paper I started a regime of 16 hours of fasting a day. I expected to find it very hard to do, but actually thrived on this approach.

Since I had formulated some strict rules for myself as to what I do and do not eat, keeping myself fed throughout the day was a bit of a challenge. Not having to worry about food for the majority of the day was incredibly freeing! Not only that, but my mental and physical energy levels increased during the times I didn't eat.

Throughout my university years I started more and more to research longevity and unconventional lifestyles to optimise the body. After the first two years of study I had converted myself to:

- Intermittent fasting
- Sauna sessions 5+ times a week
- Low carb leaning to ketogenic diet

I also continued to experiment with:

- Cognitive enhancement supplements & practices
- Alternative sleep cycles

Through the years of experimentation I learned to separate fact from fiction. Since then words like intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet have become pop culture. It's the first time I've been a hipster, I did it before it was cool. While my post-university years were when I refined a lot of my protocols and theories, the basis for all of it has been my years in the academic world.

My experiments do not turn into dogma. As new information becomes available I adapt. My goal is to make the best decisions based on the information I have at the time. My most recent change was to incorporate a larger portion of complex carbohydrates into my diet based on the longevity studies of dr Longo.

I continue to read, experiment and refine my lifestyle. Some people say it sounds exhausting, I say it sounds exciting.
