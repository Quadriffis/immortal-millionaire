# Increase life and health span through diet

Our experience of life is always through the lens of the body. Keeping the vessel we use to experience reality in shape is the ultimate investment. Like any machine our body was optimised to be used in certain ways, by respecting those we can increase the odds of living long and well.

**Principles of a longevity diet**

1. Take care of the basics first
3. Keep an eye on your blood values & compensate deficiencies
4. Consider taking supplements
4. Regularly trigger hormetic responses

## Take care of the basics first

Let's say your neighbour drives a car with a broken windshield. The came car has a squeaky door handle on the passenger side. Which do you think he should fix first?

In the example it's obviously the windshield. But when it comes to heath people are for some reason predisposed to reaching for supplements before fixing their basic lifestyle. Your body is not going to thank you for taking an experimental supplement if you are obese or out of shape.

**Basic health recommendations:**

- Institute a low GI/GL diet[^See weight loss section for a detailed overview]
- Keep your body in a healthy weight/body fat range
- Have a sports/fitness routine[^Consider combining the recommendations of the muscle and flexibility sections]

## Blood values and deficiencies

Many people seem intent on using supplements blindly. It is in most developed countries however trivial to get a blood panel that tests for useful values.

Supplements should be exactly what the name implies, supplemental consumptions. They are not designed to replace a varied diet that supplies the nutrients your body needs. They can however offer ways to:

- correct deficiencies
- offer benefits that regular foods do not

Don't blindly take supplements:

1. Get your blood tested
2. Make a game plan (supplements/food)
3. Test again a few weeks later

Note however that blood tests are not like opening the door to a room to see what is inside. You can't just "test your blood" and expect a list of results to come back. You need to test for specific things.

For each of the things you test for there is probably a different test that needs to be run on your blood. It is therefore vital to know what you want to test for.

Note that statistics can be deceiving. If for example 50% of a population is deficient in vitamin B12, that might convince you to take the supplement. If the underlying data however shows that the 50% that has this issue is over 65 years old, you may or may not change your standpoint.

On a statistical basis there are a number of supplements that could benefit a great many people:

- Vitamin d
- Vitamin B12
- Magnesium

Some values are useful simply to have a baseline of your usual values, these include:

- Iron
- Lipid panel (cholesterol etc)
- Certain hormones

Depending on your location and environment it may pay off to do tests for things like heavy metals.

Note that not all values have immediate value. Cholesterol values for example are not all that useful for many young people. Having some baseline readings however can be valuable in future scenarios.

### Vitamin D

Vitamin d is a steroid hormone. That is to say that this substance has the ability to reach the cell nucleus (where the DNA is kept) and influence what genes are expressed. In other words: vitamin d changes what part of your DNA is on and off.

Humans have two main sources of vitamin d:

- Food
- The sun

Foods high in vitamin d include for example fatty fish. One stereotypical example is cod liver oil.

Our skin is able to generate vitamin d from sunlight as well. The problem there is that in the recent parts of human existence we've spent a lot of time indoors and covering 90% of our skin surface area with sun blocking clothing.

Some common reasons for low vitamin d levels include:

- Sitting inside all day
- Having darker skin in countries with less sun
- Wearing clothing that covers a lot of skin

The effects of low vitamin d can be manifold (remember, it affects DNA expression):

- Lower mood levels
- Suboptimal immune function
- Suboptimal cognitive function
- Weaker bone and teeth

### Magnesium

This mineral is used in a large amount of functions ranging from the immune system to the brain. It's used by 300+ enzymes and without it our primary ATP based cellular energy system would not function. 

There are no international population wide statistics on magnesium levels in the blood, but depending on what study you look at as many as 60% to 80% of people are deficient in magnesium.

There are a number of issues for many people:

> Many people don't consume enough magnesium and magnesium supplements are often bad

The issue with magnesium supplements is that different types are absorbed better or worse. Not only that, but it appears that different types are preferred by certain organs.

The important magnesium types to know:

| Type | Bioavailability | Notes |
| --- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Magnesium Oxide | Extremely low | Basically magnesium rust, can cause diarrhoea. |
| Magnesium Citrate | Good | Cost effective, mild laxative in higher dosages. |
| Magnesium Gluconate & Glycinate | Good | Harder to find, more expensive. Unpleasant taste in powder form. |
| Magnesium Lactate | Excellent  | Harder to find, dissolves well into liquids. I like it in tea. |


You can check for the type of magnesium in your supplement by checking the ingredient list.

### The harm of supplements

Vitamin supplements are not without risk. Many people approach it with a "worst case it doesn't do anything" attitude. The thing is that excess vitamins too can upset the balance of your body.

The B vitamin group for example is well known to stimulate certain types of growth. This is why people take it to make nails and hair grow faster/stronger. Hypothetically however these supplements could also provide valuable fuel for tumours.

Likewise for many male consumers taking extra iron is a terrible idea and has shown to increase risk for some disease, whereas this is less so the case for women (who lose iron through menstruation).

> Don't get me wrong: no supplement is inherently good or bad

Blindly taking highly concentrated supplements is a terrible idea though. Test yourself first.

### Interesting supplements

There are a number of supplements that have the potential to support a good quality of life, or to extend lifespan potentially. Many of these are quite experimental and have only proven to work in theory or on animal models.

#### Lithium Ororate

Lithium is associated in high dosages with the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is however in low dosages an essential mineral for optimal health. It occurs naturally in low dosages (up to 0.170 mg/L in tap water). The argument has been made in a New York Times article [should we all take a bit of lithium?](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/opinion/Sunday/should-we-all-take-a-bit-of-lithium.html) that we could all benefit from a low dosage of lithium on a daily basis.

While large therapeutic dosages are classified as medicine (and rightfully so) the smaller dosed supplements are available for purchase from many supplement vendors. The dosages are greatly smaller than those in the medicinal form.

#### Collagen

The human skin is kept in shape by a scaffold made of a protein structure called collagen. This part of the 'extracellular matrix' gives skin elasticity and keeps it from wrinkling. Damage to the collagen structure is done by UVA radiation, which causes wrinkles. This is why dermatologists hammer on using sunscreen all day every day.

While preventing damage by means of sunscreen is good advice, is doesn't help your body to repair damage that is bound to occur because of daily sun exposure.

> Note that sun exposure is positive for many health factors, the downside to the positive effects is skin aging.

Intuitively it makes sense that if a certain structure in the body breaks down (collagen) you can stimulate growth by consuming more building blocks (in the form of said collagen). While the body is very cabable of constructing collagen from other protein sources, consuming collagen as such seems to have positive effects on skin elasticity.

Studies have shown that radioactively labelled collagen (it's a harmless kind of study) can be traced to places in the body where collagen is present. A small placebo controlled study found that indeed consuming collagen increases skin elasticity after a few weeks.

Note that those looking to supplement collagen don't have to put up with dissolving regular collagen into hot water and drink a foul smelling mixture. There are great hydrolysed collagen supplements on the market that smell quite neutral and dissolve in cold water.

#### Metformin

Originally a diabetes drug, this compound has shown promise in the field of life extension. It gained popularity in recent years, especially in places like silicon valley where self-experimentation is quite widespread.

Depending on your country this compound may or may not be available for sale without prescription. Regardless of availability it is advisable to consult a medical professional before choosing to take a compound with strong effects like metformin.

#### Rapamicin

Named after Rapanui (easter island) this compound has stayed in the shadows for a large number of years. Research seems to indicate that through effects on the FOXO and mTor pathways this compound increases longevity.

The research on humans however is not very extensive and the availability is low as of the time of writing. It is not a common drug or supplement and is considered experimental.

#### Adaptogens

The class of adaptogens is a group of supplements that balances stress and relaxation responses. In essence these compounds give energy for those who are low on it and provide relaxation to those who are stressed.

This may sound conflicting, but it makes sense when viewed through the lens that adaptogens work at restoring a baseline. Instead of a substance that per definition causes a dose-dependent effect in a predictable direction (e.g. alcohol) they restore balance to functions that are out of whack.

The exact mechanisms differ per supplement, and for some the exact mechanisms are not known. For many though the adaptogenic effect has been robustly documented.

Interesting adaptogens include:

- Panax Ginseng root
- Reishi mushroom extracts
- Rhodiola

Depending on your geographical location some are easier to find than others.

#### Fish oil (omega 3's)

Fish oil is known as a beneficial supplement in pop culture. The effects that are often touted include their beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system and cholesterol levels. More and more research however seems to indicate that omega 3 fatty acids also have many benefits for neurological attributes like cognitive function and mood levels.

For this supplement it is important to realise that fatty acids are essential for the structure and functioning of cells. In essence human cells are bags of water, filled with molecular machinery (DNA, mitochondria etc). The 'bag' that is the border of the cell basically uses lipids as an important building block. The right lipids keep the cell membrane flexible and functioning optimally. This is very important for many things, including nerve function.

On supplement bottles you will often find references to EPA and DHA. These are two forms of omega 3 fatty acids. Their structure differs and research indicates that their effect differs as well.

If you plan to take fish oil on a long term basis make sure that you choose a reputable supplement that is adequately purified. The fish used to produce the oil may contain toxins like heavy metals (especially if the source fish is high up the food chain) that need to be filtered out.

With regards to toxins and oil quality it pays off to look for products that:

- Are produced from animals low on the food chain (e.g. herring instead of salmon)
- Are filtered well (everybody claims this so it is harder to test)
- Has lab tests available on their website

**Recommendations for supplements:**

Note: For all deficiencies ask your doctor if there is a reason you would have lower levels due to a reason other that low intake. B12 levels can also for example be low due to malabsorption.

| Supplement | Recommendation |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Vitamin D | When far from 75nmol/L or 30ng/ml[^See [Optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels for multiple health outcomes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207384)] supplement with at least 800IU/day[^Equals 20 micrograms] |
| Vitamin B12 | Supplement or increase dietary intake of animal products, specifically liver and meat[^It's also found in eggs, but humans only absorb about 9%. See [Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959839)] |
| Magnesium | Prefer citrate, chelate and glycinate over magnesium oxide[^The magnesium type is on the bottle, just look at the ingredient section] |

### Fasting & feasting

The human body has two interesting states:

- Build stuff
- Destroy/repair broken stuff

The building cycle is important since it is the time when we build new cells, proteins and so on.

The destroy/repair state is important since broken cells and components can result in nasty things like cancer.

The caveat here is that these states can't optimally function at the same time. When the build state is dominant the repair state is less active and vice versa.

Interestingly *eating stimulates building* and *fasting stimulates repair*. In other words, feeding your body will trigger it to use those nutrients. Not feeding your body will allow your body to repair itself on a cellular level.

- Fasting triggers repair
- Feasting triggers growth

One issue our society has is that we don't give the body enough time to enter the fasting restorative mode. We eat pretty much the whole time we're awake.

There are a number of fasting 'levels' to be aware of:

| Fasting type | Effect |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Juice fast/cleanse | This is *not* fasting. It'll rest your intestines a bit but has little metabolic effect. |
| No calorie fast | Nothing with energy (caloric) content. Coffee/tea is fine, but only without sugar and milk. This is good for fasting, but might reduce some of the benefits related to elevated oxidative stress. |
| Water fast | The most effective fast usually. Harder to use in regular life. |
| Full fast | No water, no food. While the most pure fast the benefits compared to a water fast are not that much. |

#### The benefits of fasting

The average human body can live for 3 days without water and 3 weeks without food. On a biological level not eating for a full day is really not that extreme. Many have argued that in the human hunter/gather days it was quite common to eat a lot one day (caught an animal) and nothing the next (caught no animal).

Fasting and intermittent fasting have shown a number of interesting effects on both animals and humans. Note that this is very recent research so it's all still very experimental.

So far there are strong indications for:

- Reduced risk for certain cancers
- Reduced risk of mental disease
- Increased lifespan

There are a lot of cellular and metabolic effects that you can read about online[^See [The science of fasting for longevity & health](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/i-didnt-eat-for-105-hours-science-benefits/)].

While any extreme lifestyle change should be discussed with a medical professional, there are for most people no health risks involved in fasting.

#### Ketosis: metabolic plan B

The body usually relies on a glycolytic pathway for energy. In other words, we usually run on carbohydrates. The body mostly supplies energy to the muscle and brain through blood sugar.

For many people this is the reason they feel low when they have not eaten (low blood sugar) or when they have just eaten (blood sugar spike followed by insulin spike).

There is an alternative energy mechanism called ketosis. In this state the body does not break down carbohydrates but rather fats. Instead of using blood sugar for primary energy delivery, the body uses ketones.

Being in ketosis has a host of health benefits. The list is very similar to fasting. Indeed a great deal of the benefits of fasting stem from the fact that fasting helps trigger ketosis.

Entering a ketotic state is done by depriving the body of carbohydrates. A ketogenic diet is often 80%+ fats. Longer fasts result in ketosis, and thus supply benefits similar to the ketogenic diet.

#### Time restricted feeding

The human body has an internal clock referred to as the circadian rhythm. There are two important factors that help your body calibrate it's clock:

- The first moment you are exposed to bright light
- The first moment you use your liver

Bright light is a 'sunrise' mechanism. The liver is used to digest food, but is also impacted by for example coffee.

There as strong indications that eating within a window that falls in the waking 'daylight' time (e.g. 08:00 to 20:00) has health benefits.

## Intermittent fasting

It takes the body a while to enter recovery mode once you start fasting. When you eat something during a fasted state the countdown timer starts anew. In other words, if you have a juice after fasting for 5 hours, your fast is now broken and you have now fasted for 0 hours.

One approach to implementing fasting into your life is intermittent fasting. Popular approaches include:

*The 16/8 approach* where you only eat for 8 consecutive hours a day and fast the rest of the day. For example only eating between 16:00 and 24:00. When the window is doesn't matter (caveats later on), what matters is that for 16 hours you do not eat or drink anything with caloric content. Most fasters do still consume coffee and tea without milk and sugar.

*The 5/2 approach* in which you eat regularly for 5 days a week but eat very little or nothing 2 days a week. While health benefits can be found when 2 days are very low on energy consumption, the body will only fully benefit if there is a period of actual fasting.

*Alternate day fasting* is exactly what it sounds like. You eat for one day, and do not eat the next.

**Template: Intermittent fasting**

The most popular option (and most compatible with most people's lives is the 16/8 approach. To get started, choose your eight hour eating window. Keep in mind that the window needs to:

- Cover all your energy needs. E.g. 08:00 to 16:00 requires dinner before 16:00
- Be conducive to finding food. Evenings work best if you work full time and cook at home.
- Compatible with your daily routine, think work(out)/social etc

Other important considerations:

- Most people report having the best mental focus when **fasting**.
- After adjusting many people report feeling sluggish when eating too early.
- Eat the right stuff, start with a protein rich meal (for the sake of satiety). Focus on low GI etc. See the diet section.
- Have backup food on you. E.g. always have a box of nuts on you.
- Be strict but reasonable. Yearly family brunches are a fine reason not to fast.
- Biologically eating earlier in the day is advantageous due to the circadian rhythm

### Fast mimicking diet

Longer fasts result in more dramatic health benefits. They are however also harder to do, and are not practical for certain target groups. It is for example known that fasting reduces some side effects of chemotherapy. Having a cancer patient fast is often not responsible or doable though.

Dr Valter Longo pioneered a multi-day fasting approach that still allows for some nutrition, but is very selective in what one is allowed to eat. The idea is to keep the effects of fasting, while not fasting entirely.

While the official fast mimicking diet is distributed as a commercial product, the tenets of this approach are:

- Low caloric intake (sub 1000 kCal)
- Low protein & carbohydrate (under 10% & 50%)
- High fat (over 40%)
- No antioxidants (coffee, green/black tea etc)

Self experimenters online also suggest using only high medium-chain-triglyceride oil like coconut oil as an energy source. Supplementation with salt is also advised since the body loses salt when glycogen stores are depleted during fasting.

**Template: Multi-day keto fast mimicking diet**

This is an interpretation of the fast mimicking diet designed to support you reaching ketosis. *First off, a multi day fast is quite extreme. Consult a medical professional if this is your first time.*

The rules are simple:

| Hours/day | Rules |
| --- | ----- |
| 24h (day 1) | Coffee, tea, max 4 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| 48h (day 2) | Water. Max 2 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| 72h (day 3) | Water. Max 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Tsp salt. |
| 98h (day 4) | Water. Tsp salt. |
| day 5 | Breakfast. |

The coconut oil is rich in medium chain triglycerides (MCT) which are easy to convert into ketones. It is recommended to buy a device to measure your blood ketones[^For example the Abbott Freestyle Optium Neo. You need to get both glucose and ketone strips. Ketone strips are markedly more expensive than glucose ones.]. Urine strips are not very accurate.

Tips to make the most out of your fast:

- Have things to do
- Don't be around food if you don't have to be
- Go for a brisk 1 hour walk on the first day (help get into ketosis)
- If you must have coffee/tea the whole duration (very suboptimal!) go for teas without antioxidants/caffeine (e.g. camomile) and coffee without sugar/milk.


## How I found out

My bachelors degree turned out to be a double blessing. Not only did I get to explore human biology through curriculum, but many classes required me to write research papers on a topic of my choice.

It took some convincing in some cases, but in many cases I could use these papers to dive deeper into subjects that interested me. One pivotal moment was a metabolism paper I wrote called "Resveratrol bioavailability and Action". It was by no means a masterpiece, but triggered the interesting notion that the human body has built in mechanisms that increase lifespan.

You see, resveratrol was at the time considered a promising life extension compound. It's a powerful antioxidant that influences gene expression. It seemed to:

- Protect against cancer
- Activate the SIRT1 gene group who's equivalent extends life in other organisms
- Buffer the effects of high cholesterol

It turns out that resveratrol supplementation in humans is not all that effective since our liver metabolises it very quickly.

Nonetheless my interest was piqued. The SIRT1 gene group spoke to my imagination. Specifically the idea that the human body is capable of extending it's lifespan if we take the right steps in our lifestyle.

This lead me to an interest into epigenetics, the study of how the environment influences gene expression. One important thing to understand here is that genes are not a blueprint for the human body in the way that pop-culture sometimes presents it.

Human genes are an if-this-then-that system. If a certain stimulus is given human cells are programmed to respons in a certain way. For example (simplified):

- Sunlight > activate melanin genes > darker skin
- Vitamin d > influences hundreds of genes > changes in bone, mood, immune system etc

I felt like I had discovered something magical. After hearing my entire life that genes are a static blueprint that make my body what it is, I now knew that my genes are just a large repository of potential outcomes.

While resveratrol seemed to be a bust, my interest into longevity was piqued. Specifically, many studies seemed to talk about insulin when talking about longevity. Even resveratrol had a close link to insulin and related measures. A later paper I wrote called "The role of insulin in fasting metabolism and gene expression" was my first touchpoint with what I would later learn to call intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet.

During the researching of this paper I found some things I at the time called counterintuitive, for example:

- Fasting increases growth hormone levels
- The body is perfectly capable of producing glucose without eating carbohydrates (or anything for that matter)
- Fasting periodically has similar benefits to limiting food consumption
- Fasting is good for the brain

In that particular paper I learned the basics of FoxO and mTor functions and how they relate to fasting and longevity.

As much as I enjoyed the rabbit hole of academic research, I'm a practically inclined person. After handing in this paper I started a regime of 16 hours of fasting a day. I expected to find it very hard to do, but actually thrived on this approach.

Since I had formulated some strict rules for myself as to what I do and do not eat, keeping myself fed throughout the day was a bit of a challenge. Not having to worry about food for the majority of the day was incredibly freeing! Not only that, but my mental and physical energy levels increased during the times I didn't eat.

Throughout my university years I started more and more to research longevity and unconventional lifestyles to optimise the body. After the first two years of study I had converted myself to:

- Intermittent fasting
- Sauna sessions 5+ times a week
- Low carb leaning to ketogenic diet

I also continued to experiment with:

- Cognitive enhancement supplements & practices
- Alternative sleep cycles

Through the years of experimentation I learned to separate fact from fiction. Since then words like intermittent fasting and ketogenic diet have become pop culture. It's the first time I've been a hipster, I did it before it was cool.

While my post-university years were when I refined a lot of my protocols and theories, the basis for all of it has been my years in the academic world.
