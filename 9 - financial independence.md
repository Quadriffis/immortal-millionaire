# Financial goal setting

The question is simple: how much money do you need to survive? Do you know your number? Most people don't. Let me tell you mine:

> To live in the center of Amsterdam in a nice apartment and have my basic needs met, I need **â‚¬400,000**.

That number may come as a surprise to a lot of people. In order to retire with a decent lifestyle you do not need millions, of course depending on what kind of lifestyle you are aiming for. Personally I plan to have a lifestyle grander to what I described above.

The following section will detail how to get to a point where you know exactly:

- How much money you need to retire at any age
- Where your money goes every month
- How to automate your finances

## How to fi/re yourself

The goal of money management is to become fi/re: Financially Independent / Retired.

The magic that makes this possible is that you can make your money generate income through relatively low risk investment strategies that have stood the test of time. We live in a golden age for those who take time to decypher the basic rules of our monetary system.

THe idea behind fi/re is that you invest a certain amount of money that will on a yearly basis generate income for you. The amazing thing there is that the amount of money you have does not decrease on a yearly basis, meaning you can hypothetically live off of it forever.

Note: many people who reach fi/re do not actually retire, but rather spend time only on jobs/clients/projects that they really enjoy. They feel no pressure to take a job they don't like.

## The ingredients

I order to reach fi/re we need three pieces of crucial knowledge:

- A solid budget system
- How much money you need to save/invest
- How you effectively invest money

The coming sections will explore these elements.
