# Manage a budget

Proposed infographic:

- 1&2: Show a transparent house where there are text bubbles describig costs (maybe the person and his girlfriend are prepping to go out for dinner? Takeout coffee cup on the table?). Next to the house have two lists: must spend and optional spending
- Show 3 cards with icons showing the different expense types. Only the daily operations card has an arrow to a wallet, the others to s cupboard.
- Visualise the YNAB way, maybe ask then for permission? Not sure what the copyright status is.
- Show a person spending on a pair of shoes with a halo around it. Also spending money on a present (with thought buble of another person's face)

1. Create a list of monthly expenses you can't avoid (e.g. rent)
2. Create a list of optional expenses that you consistently spend (e.g. coffee)
3. Set up 3 accounts
	- One for daily operations (card is in your wallet)
	- One for automated payments (wages coming in, rent going out etc)
	- One for savings and investment purposes (should not even have a card)
4. Embrace the YNAB way
	- Give Every Dollar [ or Euro ] A Job
	- Embrace Your True Expenses
	- Roll With The Punches
	- Age Your Money
5. Stick to your budget by embracing human nature
	- Have a 'guilt free' budget category for frivolous spending
	- Consider a 'sharing the love' account of money you spend only on others

## Why and how this works

Let's get one thing straight: budgetting is about freedom.

I love budgetting. It gives a feeling of control and freedom. After my monthly budget session (30 minutes) I have zero anxiety over money.

The goal of a budget is not to make you feel like you are limiting yourself. It is about being in a situation where you can spend money without the anxiety of wondering whether you can afford something.

A good budget:

- Plans for expenses (rent, food)
- Incorporates fun (a 'guilt free' budget)
- Makes you feel in control

### Step 1: certain expenses

Begin by making a list of expenses you know you reliably make on a monthly basis. For many people this includes things like rent, food and transport.

It is of paramount importance to know exactly which financial responsibilities you have. Below is an example of my budget when I lived in Amsterdam[^I rounded off the numbers].

| Expense | Monthly size in € |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl gas/water/electricity) | 780 |
| Food | 400 |
| Cellphone plan | 30 |
| Healthcare insurance | 110 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Property insurances[^Dutch people insure pretty much everything] | 25 |
| **Total** | 1380 |

The above expenses are things I was 100% sure of they would be charged to my account.

### Step 2: Variable expenses

The above are expenses that are out of my control to the point that I can't just decide to not buy them for a month. Besides these there were a number of things that were optional, but quite reliably expenses. Go through your bank statements and find patterns.

| Expense | Average expenditure per month in € |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Massages | 200 |
| Espressos | 20 |
| 'Splurge foods' | 100 |
| Total | **320** |

The above expenses are reliable enough to calculate into your budget in a flexible manner. For me personally the above translated into a monthly budget category 'wellness' of 200 and a 'guilt free spending' of 200 to account for other variable expenses.

### Step 3: The structure

How you categorise your expenses is up to you, what is important however is that only a very small amount of unforeseen expenses are allowed to be without a category.

For me personally the budget looked as follows:

| Budget Category | Monthly size in € |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl gas/water/electriity) | 780 |
| Food | 400 |
| Cellphone plan | 30 |
| Healthcare insurance | 110 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Property insurances[^Dutch people insure pretty much everything] | 25 |
| Wellness | 200 |
| Guilt free | 120 |

Based on this table I know that I need €1380 every month to survive and another €320 to do the things I love (massages, coffee).

The above table means that:

- Every month I knew I had (or didn't have) enough money
- I knew how much money to save to have 6 months of living expenses saved

### Step 4: The YNAB way

I am a very big fan of a budgeting software called You Need A Budget (YNAB for short). They approach budgeting with 4 rules:

1. Give Every Dollar [ or Euro ] A Job
2. Embrace Your True Expenses
3. Roll With The Punches
4. Age Your Money

I love their approach. They have a great page dedicated to their suggested system[^YNAB Method, https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/].

Brief explatations (copied from their webpage):

1. *As soon as you get money, you’ll decide what it needs to do—whatever is most important to you. Then, instead of deciding to buy something based on your mood, or the big (or small?) pile of money in your checking account, you’ll decide based on a rock-solid plan.*
2. *Take those large, less-frequent expenses (that usually send you into a financial tailspin) and break them into manageable, monthly “bills.”  Good-bye, Financial Crisis Roller Coaster! You just won a free ticket on the Financial Peace Express!*
3. *When you overspend in a budget category, just adjust. No guilt necessary. If you plan to take the kids to the beach but it’s pouring down rain, do you still go? Of course not! Circumstances change and plans change with them. Your budget is no different. If you overspend in one category, free up money from another category and move along. Remember, you’re the boss!*
4. *With the help of the other three rules, you’ll be more purposeful about your spending, consistently spend less than you earn, and be more than prepared for the future. Eventually, you’ll be able to cover May’s rent with dollars from April. Your money will be at least 30 days old and you’ll wonder how you ever lived without the Four Rules.*

I highly suggest getting a free trial[^Use my referral link and get a free month: http://bit.ly/free-month-ynab] with them and give it a shot. It has been a significantly positive effect on my financial life.

### Embrace flexibility and automation

Budgeting is not about giving you an extra chore or making your life more difficult. I highly suggest structuring your financial life accordingly.

**Automate your finances** by making sure all your bills are paid automatically. Rent and other expenses should *never* take extra overhead.

**Have 3 accounts** for different purposes. One called 'center' for automated expenses (your paycheck goes here) of which the card is not in your wallet. One called 'guilt free' which is in your wallet and contains limited money for food and fun (max €200 on there per week). And one called 'savings' for stashing money.

**Have a guilt free category** budget fun into your life. Have a category of money you can spend without justification. Don't make it too much, but enough for smaller fun expenses.

**Sharing the love** is one of my favorite categories. It is a small budget category that you can only spend on other people. From charities to taking a friend out for dinner. It's a very fulfilling (optional) part of a budget.

## How I found out

My father has done a lot of projects in Croatia. For the family that meant we went to visit this sunny mediteranean country pretty much every summer. One thing that got me and my brothers in a frenzy was the difference in currency. One euro was usually the equivalent of 7 Croatian kunas. The weeks before the holiday we turned the house upside down for kunas, either those left from last holiday or pocket change my dad left lying around.

Money played an important role for us children in the holidays. We each got 10 kunas a day to spend as we saw fit. In practice this meant it was icecream money. It's not that my parents didn't buy us icecream, but we didn't get to decide when they would buy us frozen deliciousness.

After having breakfast we would spend the morning arguing what was the best icecream to get:

- The water based sticks were cheap so we would get 5 of them
- The creamy icecreams were more expensive, often allowing only 1 a day
- The magnums were often over 10 kunas, meaning getting one meant abstaining from icecream for a day

Obsessing over icecream taught me many things about managing money. Especially about balancing the desires you have right this second, and how they relate to the posibility of a novel experience (or icecream) at a later date.

Aside from teaching us the rudementary principles of a budget, we many times ended up finding ways to make more money. Either we would bet against eachother, or we would dive up pretty shells and sell them as necklaces in town.

Once we got older and had our own bank accounts we no longer had the constraint of 10 kunas a day of course, but the lessons remained.

While the foundation for my current budgeting skills was laid in my childhood, it took until university to crystallise into a solid and specific budget system. University was an exercise similar to my childhood holidays. The Dutch government would give me a specific amount of money each month, and I had to survive on it.

The first months I played by ear and mostly managed. I like being self sufficient, so the idea of asking my parents for food money because I failed to plan properly was horrifying. I knew they would help me, but I viscerally didn't want to need help. Truth be told I had to ask for help anyway in the first year, which fuelled my desire to figure out my finances.

A world opened for me once I started really measuring my expenditures. Using apps to track my spending meant I could at the end of the month diagnose where exactly my money went and why. Not only that, but the act of recording my spending made me think twice about whether the expense was justified.

I reached my budgeting heaven when I discovered You Need A Budget. At the time it was still a standalone piece of software which I bought through the gaming platform steam. It's ironic that my favorite budgeting program was purchased during a game discount sale.

Using YNAB and their structure made me feel excited to do my monthly budget. Honestly, I didn't have enough money to even use the functionality to it's fullest extent. I was supposed to save up enough money to cover the expenses for next month, what YNAB calls 'ageing your money'. I started saving towards it and expected to take 6 months to a year to get there.

YNAB really had an impact once I started working. By this time I had a good handle on my money, I knew my expenses and how to manage them in a predictable manner. Now that money actually started flowing in I started accumulating a buffer and even investment money. I was not making all that much, but because I had a good budgeting structure I grew my net worth quicker than any of my friends.

I learned from these developments that what worked for me:

- Starting budgeting before you have proper income
- Consider saving a present for your future self (I even labeled saving transactions as such)
- Set aside reasonable money for guilt free spending

I've now solidified a budget structure I find a joy to work with. I've set aside 6+ months of living expenses so I can take my time switching jobs if I want, have money set aside to invest in different things and get to buy toys & tech without feeling guilty over it. I even have a budget category for money I can only spend on other people (thank you Tony Robbins for that suggestion).

It was a revelation for me that budgeting doesn't have to be painful but can be fun instead.
