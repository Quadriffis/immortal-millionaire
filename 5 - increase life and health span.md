# Increase life and health span

**Recipe**

1. Take care of the basics first
2. Compensate for deficiencies
3. Keep an eye on your blood values
4. Regularly trigger hormetic responses

**Tools**

Basic health recommendations:

- Institute a low GI/GL diet[^See weight loss section for a detailed overview]
- Keep your body in a healthy weight/body fat range
- Have a sports/fitness routine[^Consider combining the recommendations of the muscle and flexibility sections]

Interesting blood values:

- Common deficiencies
	- Vitamin d
	- Vitamin B12
	- Magnesium
- Interesting values
	- Iron
	- Lipid panel (cholesterol etc)
	- Certain hormones
	- Ask your doctos what is interesting for your demographic

Recommendations for supplements:

Note: For all deficiencies ask your doctor if there is a reason you would have lower levels due to a reason other that low intake. B12 levels can also for example be low due to malabsorption.

| Supplement | Recommendation |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| Vitamin D | When far from 75nmol/L or 30ng/ml[^See 'Optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels for multiple health outcomes', https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25207384] supplement with at least 800IU/day[^Equals 20 micrograms] |
| Vitamin B12 | Supplement or increase dietary intake of animal products, specifically liver and meat[^It's also found in eggs, but humans only absorb about 9%. See 'Vitamin B12 sources and bioavailability', https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17959839] |
| Magnesium | Prefer citrate, chelate, glycinate over magnesium oxide[^The magnesium type is on the bottle, just look at the ingredient section] |

Hormetic responses in a controlled environment:

| Trigger | Intensity/frequency |
| ------- | --------- |
| Sauna | More[^As measured by the amount of days per week you enter the sauna] & hotter[^Commonly researched temperatures are 80 and 100 degrees celcius] appears to be better[^See this excellent sauna breakdown by dr Rhonda Pattrick: https://www.foundmyfitness.com/reports/sauna-report.pdf] |
| Cold exposure | Colder is better, duration is less important[^20 seconds at 4.4 celcius appeared equal to 2 minutes at -110 celcius cryotherapy. See 'Effects of long‐term whole‐body cold exposures on plasma concentrations of ACTH, beta‐endorphin, cortisol, catecholamines and cytokines in healthy females', http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00365510701516350]. The minimum temperature seems to be around the 14 celcius mark[^See 'Human physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures', https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004210050065] |
| Intermittent fasting | Common approaches are 16/8[^16 hours of fasting per day, 8 hour eating window] and 5/2[^5 days of regular eating followed by 2 days of fasting or low caloric intake]. I use 16/8. |
| Multi-day fasting | While water fasts are most optimal a 5 day fast mimicking diet approach has many of the same benefits |
