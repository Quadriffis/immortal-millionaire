## Muscle gain vs strength

Before reading this section keep in mind the following things:

1. Most people don't need most muscle, just less fat
2. Strength and muscle size are not the same

Before deciding on any course of action, be sure what your goals are. If you want to look in shape, usually losing weight through diet is the best course of action. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do exercise, but rather that you shouldn't rely on exercise alone to look more fit.

### Gaining muscle (hypertrophy): 2 variables

To increase your lean muscle mass there are many very effective techniques. They all rely on two basic variables:

1. Trigger muscle growth
2. Eat relevant food

Triggering muscle growth is simple in principle. You want to send your muscles the signal that they are not sufficient. Exhausting your muscles by doing heavy things basically gives the signal of:

> I had to fight/run for my survival, and these muscles were barely suficient.

By stretching your limits in exercise you tell your body to activate the set of genes that causes the growth of muscles. Some people have easy to trigger genes, meaning a little exercise shows great result. Others need a heavier stimulus.

The second factor is feeding your body the building blocks it needs to grow muscle. In simple terms: proteins. There is a lot of nuance there to do with bioavailability and amino acid makeup, but in essence it comes down to those two questions.
