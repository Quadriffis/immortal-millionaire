## Have a clear game plan

Your plan of action is what will shape your actual behavior. It is of the utmost importance that your plan makes sense in the following ways:

1. It is clear in what you are going to do
1. The plan is within realistic bounds
1. There are clear triggers

A vague plan like 'I will exercise more' can never succeed because the goal is not defined. A plan like 'I will do 5 push ups per day' works much better. Ideally you formulate a trigger as well, like 'I will do 5 push ups per day right before my daily shower'.

The above plan checks all boxes:

1. The plan (5 push ups a day) is clear
2. You are capable of 5 push-ups a day (if now, lower the number)
3. There is a clear trigger for your intended habit

Another example may be saving money. The goal 'I want to save more money' could be formulated as 'I will transfer 10% of my paycheck to my savings account the day after I receive my wages'.

## Set up motivational structures

After a clear game plan you need to make sure that you have the right internal and external pressures to keep you going. For detailed strategies please read the chapter on motivation. The most important elements for habit formation are:

- Writing down the cost of failure
- Writing down the benefit of success
- Set up accountability
