## Have a clear game plan

Your plan of action is what will shape your actual behavior. It is of the utmost importance that your plan makes sense in the following ways:

1. It is clear in what you are going to do
1. The plan is within realistic bounds
1. There are clear triggers

A vague plan like 'I will exercise more' can never succeed because the goal is not defined. A plan like 'I will do 5 push ups per day' works much better. Ideally you formulate a trigger as well, like 'I will do 5 push ups per day right before my daily shower'.

The above plan checks all boxes:

1. The plan (5 push ups a day) is clear
2. You are capable of 5 push-ups a day (if now, lower the number)
3. There is a clear trigger for your intended habit

Another example may be saving money. The goal 'I want to save more money' could be formulated as 'I will transfer 10% of my paycheck to my savings account the day after I receive my wages'.

## Set up motivational structures

After a clear game plan you need to make sure that you have the right internal and external pressures to keep you going. For detailed strategies please read the chapter on motivation. The most important elements for habit formation are:

- Writing down the cost of failure
- Writing down the benefit of success
- Set up accountability
- Create a path of least resistance

The motivational elements are as important as setting well defined goals with well defined triggers. In particular closely read the section on accountability, which is for most people the most powerful driver.

## Stack the environment in your favor

Humans are physical creatures. The space around us and the things we are exposed to very strongly influence or decisions. Imagine how hard it would be to avoid eating sugar when you are in Willy Wonks's chocolate factory...

The idea here is to influence two variables:

- Making sticking to your habit easy and fun
- Making deviating from your habit dificult and painful

Your environment in the very physical sense should be conducive to sticking to your new habit. Consider what you need to institute your nnew habit and have it around. Similarly remove things that will tempt you to break your new habit. If you are trying to drink more water, make sure you always have a bottle of water with you. If you are trying to eat less candy, make sure there is no candy in the house.

For many habits it pays off to have cues and reminders. Personally I find post-its very helpful. Stick reminders for your new habits in places you see often. I personally favor doors into rooms I am bound to visit multiple times a day like the bathroom/shower. You may opt for very direct triggers. An example of that is hanging a pull-up bar in a doorpost you walk through often. You may also opt for digital cues. I for example have a 'go to bed' alarm that rings at night. Likewise when I open apps on my phone that tent to turn into time-sinks (email, reddit, instagram) I get a popup asking 'are you sure you want to spend time and focus on this?' for 5 seconds.

To make sticking to your habit more fun, make sure to have a conducive environment and equipment set. For example, I find stretching far more enjoyable on a high quality yoga mat, causing me to stretch more consistently. Likewise if you are trying to cook healthier food, make sure to have tools like good knives to make it easier and more enjoyable. This is not just true for equipment. If you are trying to take up meditation for example it pays off to explore what location in your house/office/school is most silent during the times you like to meditate. I used to use an empty room where people dumped whiteboards and unused chairs for my afternoon meditation session at work.

In the same way that you make desirable behavior easier, you want to introduce pain for undesirable behavior.

One form of pain is introducing extra effort. You would be surprised at the effectiveness of things like:

- Browser extensions that block social media
- Having the bulk of your money in an account without a card
- Putting the chocolate in a cupboard high enough that you need a chair to reach it

These obstacles are all surmountable. After all you can disable a browser extension, use your banking app to transfer money to the account that does have a card, or use a chair to reach the chocolate. Funily enough that extra little effort is often what we humans need to decide it is not worth it.

Another very effective method is committing money to things. Consider two scenarios, one in which you pay for 10 sessions with a personal trainer and one where you pay the trainer after each session. Which of those scenarios do you think would result in more sessions with your personal trainer? You can do this with plenty of new habits. Sink some cost into it combined with the other techniques in this section and you are likely to increase your odds of success. The reason this workd is that not sticking to your habit after you have sunk money into it feels like (and is) losing money. Remember the risk aversion we discussed in the previous section? Here it is again helping us out.
