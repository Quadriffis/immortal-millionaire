## Have a clear game plan

Your plan of action is what will shape your actual behavior. It is of the utmost importance that your plan makes sense in the following ways:

1. It is clear in what you are going to do
1. The plan is within realistic bounds
1. There are clear triggers

A vague plan like 'I will exercise more' can never succeed because the goal is not defined. A plan like 'I will do 5 push ups per day' works much better. Ideally you formulate a trigger as well, like 'I will do 5 push ups per day right before my daily shower'.

The above plan checks all boxes:

1. The plan (5 push ups a day) is clear
2. You are capable of 5 push-ups a day (if now, lower the number)
3. There is a clear trigger for your intended habit

Another example may be saving money. The goal 'I want to save more money' could be formulated as 'I will transfer 10% of my paycheck to my savings account the day after I receive my wages'.

## Set up motivational structures

After a clear game plan you need to make sure that you have the right internal and external pressures to keep you going. For detailed strategies please read the chapter on motivation. The most important elements for habit formation are:

- Writing down the cost of failure
- Writing down the benefit of success
- Set up accountability
- Create a path of least resistance

The motivational elements are as important as setting well defined goals with well defined triggers. In particular closely read the section on accountability, which is for most people the most powerful driver.

## Stack the environment in your favor

Humans are physical creatures. The space around us and the things we are exposed to very strongly influence or decisions. Imagine how hard it would be to avoid eating sugar when you are in Willy Wonks's chocolate factory...

The idea here is to influence two variables:

- Making sticking to your habit easy and fun
- Making deviating from your habit dificult and painful

Your environment in the very physical sense should be conducive to sticking to your new habit. Consider what you need to institute your nnew habit and have it around. Similarly remove things that will tempt you to break your new habit. If you are trying to drink more water, make sure you always have a bottle of water with you. If you are trying to eat less candy, make sure there is no candy in the house.

For many habits it pays off to have cues and reminders. Personally I find post-its very helpful. Stick reminders for your new habits in places you see often. I personally favor doors into rooms I am bound to visit multiple times a day like the bathroom/shower. You may opt for very direct triggers. An example of that is hanging a pull-up bar in a doorpost you walk through often. You may also opt for digital cues. I for example have a 'go to bed' alarm that rings at night. Likewise when I open apps on my phone that tent to turn into time-sinks (email, reddit, instagram) I get a popup asking 'are you sure you want to spend time and focus on this?' for 5 seconds.

To make sticking to your habit more fun, make sure to have a conducive environment and equipment set. For example, I find stretching far more enjoyable on a high quality yoga mat, causing me to stretch more consistently. Likewise if you are trying to cook healthier food, make sure to have tools like good knives to make it easier and more enjoyable. This is not just true for equipment. If you are trying to take up meditation for example it pays off to explore what location in your house/office/school is most silent during the times you like to meditate. I used to use an empty room where people dumped whiteboards and unused chairs for my afternoon meditation session at work.

In the same way that you make desirable behavior easier, you want to introduce pain for undesirable behavior.

One form of pain is introducing extra effort. You would be surprised at the effectiveness of things like:

- Browser extensions that block social media
- Having the bulk of your money in an account without a card
- Putting the chocolate in a cupboard high enough that you need a chair to reach it

These obstacles are all surmountable. After all you can disable a browser extension, use your banking app to transfer money to the account that does have a card, or use a chair to reach the chocolate. Funily enough that extra little effort is often what we humans need to decide it is not worth it.

Another very effective method is committing money to things. Consider two scenarios, one in which you pay for 10 sessions with a personal trainer and one where you pay the trainer after each session. Which of those scenarios do you think would result in more sessions with your personal trainer? You can do this with plenty of new habits. Sink some cost into it combined with the other techniques in this section and you are likely to increase your odds of success. The reason this workd is that not sticking to your habit after you have sunk money into it feels like (and is) losing money. Remember the risk aversion we discussed in the previous section? Here it is again helping us out.

## Have specific triggers

Effective triggers for habit formation come in the form of:

- **Location** - e.g. doing five push-ups when you get home
- **Time** - e.g. going to bed at 22:00
- **Activity** - e.g. read a page of an interesting book when you go to the bathroom
- **Feeling** - e.g. when I feel like smoking I will go for a walk instead

Depending on the habit you are trying to institute you can implement one of multiple triggers of any kind. It is important to make sure that triggers are realistic and that the corresponsing habit is easy to execute.

Triggers are most effective when there is an outside force reminding you of them. If you just decide to go to bed at 10 every day, there is a high likelyhood that there will be times you will lose track of time and fail to stick to your habit.

Personally I find the following reminder mechhanisms most effective:

- Location based reminders
- Digital reminders
- Social reminders

Location based reminders can be the previously discussed post-its, but also for example making sure there are interesting books in your bathroom or having a pull-up bar in one or multiple doorposts.

Digital reminders have many forms. The obvious choice is setting recurring alarms, for example the bed time alarm mentioned before. Smartphones can do a lot more though. For example, most androids and iphones can give location based reminders (e.g. a notification when you get home). Likewise your digital calendar can be used to plan in workouts or even daily meditation sessions.

Social reminders depend on other people. For a while I combined this with digital reminders to institute a daily meditation practice. I would sit down to meditate at 12:00 every day together with my little brother who was in Australia at the time. We would have a quick exchange through a messaging app beforehand and would ask each other how it went after. Likewise you can ask a co-worker to remind you to go for a walk at lunch, or have your significant other remind you that you haven't worked out today.

## Commit for 30 days

First off, there is nothing magical about the number 30. It just turns out we are socially conditioned to see 30 days as a standardised amount of time because of our calendar system. 

The power behind this commitment technique starts with the fact that implementing a habit for the rest of your life sounds incredibly significant and dificult. Contrarily, most people are pretty sure they can stick to even dificult new habits for 30 days.

Once something has a clear end date, a 'light at the end of the tunnel' if you will, it becomes easier to stick to it. The key here is that you are allowed to stop the habit after these 30 days. It's kind of like a 30 day free trial on a habit.

The funny thing about doing something for 30 days is that after they are over, many people find out that a habit has now become exactly that, a habit. This means that after the initial 30 days, most people find it trivially easy to keep the habit going.

To make your chances of success higher, you will of course have to combine this with the above techniques. But for many people using this technique makes it significantly easier to institute a new habit.
