# Motivate yourself

If there was a magical button that would make a smoker stop smoking, or the obese get in shape, most of them would press it. Yet most people don't change their behavior. Motivation is the skill of changing your behavior. It is the superpower that can give you a lean body, a sharp mind and great satisfaction.

## Motivation is not a feeling

Motivation is the expression of one simple question: why are you doing this? Consider an extreme thought experiment where a psychopath holds a gun to your head and tells you to burn down your house. Assuming you are sane and choose your life over your house, what motivated you? Did you simply "feel motivated that day"?

Motivation can take many forms. Many people split these into intrinsic and extrinsic mototivation. Where intrinsic motivation is 'I want to do this because I like it' and extrinsic motivation is 'my friend will give me a cookie if I do this'.

I don't care much for that distinction. It's quite arbitrary. In my view both are a case of "if I do X I am rewarded with Y". In the case of intrinsic motivation the Y is simply a feeling instead of a thing. So what I've found a more effective perspective is emotional vs material motivation.

Emotional motivation is a form where you do something to gain or avoid a feeling. Like working out because it makes you feel better about yourself. Material motivation is a form where you will get an object in return for your action. For example, getting a cookie from your friend if you do their laundry.

Emotional motivation is the most powerful type. It is the desire to feel some things like pleasure, pride and satisfaction or to avoid feelings of pain, insecurity and fear. Motivation is not a feeling. It is a desire to create a certain outcome. Maybe the outcome you desire is not being shot by a psychopath, maybe you want someone to respect you.

Either way, motivating yourself is about making clear to yourself what reward you seek, and to keep in mind how badly you want that reward. In my humble opinion, that reward is most effective when it has a strong emotional component.

## Inspiration is temporary

You know those moments (or even days) when you feel this emotional drive to get things done? Most people mix up this feeling of inspiration with motivation. Inspiration is the spark you feel when watching an inspiring movie, listening to inspiring music or whatever gets you going. Motivation is a force that gets you to do something, regardless of what or how you feel.

If you feel inspired to lose weight for example, that is not the time to go for a workout. That is the time to plan your workouts for the coming 3 weeks and set up accountability measures.

Inspiration is temporary. Do not depend on it to get things done. Inspiration is fickle, you can't rely on it. If you wake up tomorrow and don't feel inspired, that would mean you could get nothing done that day.

Fact of the matter is that self-motivating people don't feel inspired all the time. They get things done regardless of how they feel. Through discipline and self management. This is easier than it sounds, especially if you harness feelings of inspiration to set up motivational structures.

## Write down the reward & punishment

Regardless of what you want, there is great power in expressing why you want something as well as the price of not achieving it. Say for example you want to learn a new language.

You want this because:

- It will make you feel smart
- You know your friends will think highly of you
- The people in your favorite holiday country will love you for speaking their language
- You will feel like you proved wrong your cousin who said you can't do it

If you fail to complete the challenge:

- You will feel mediocre
- Your friends will think you are a quitter
- The people in St. Holiday will think you another dumb tourist
- Your cousin will hold this over your head

By expressing these things clearly and reminding yourself of them you can create motivation. Whenever it's the end of a long day and you don't want to do your daily language practice, imagine how you will feel when you achieve it, and imagine the face of your cousin as they will laugh at your failure.

## Quantify your goals

Good goals can be measured in a clear way. The goal "I want more money" is not a good goal. If I give you a cent/penny it will be fulfilled. A good financial goal is "I want to have a 400,000 investment portfolio".

Measurable goals are key for motivating yourself for 2 reasons:

- They make the finish line clear
- They allow you to track your progress

Depending on your nature you can either gently track your progress or go nuts on it. Tracking your weight by the week for example is fine for some people who want to shed fat. I know of others who measure twice daily on a smart scale and use the resulting graph in the accompanying app as motivation.

## Create a path of least resistance

Another step in motivating yourself is to make the right path the easiest path to choose. That involves two parts:

1. Making it pleasurable to do the task
2. Making it painful not to do the task

Take the writing of this book for example. I took concrete steps to make writing it more pleasureble. For me that meant writing it in a markup language called Markdown in a writing program called byword.

Likewise I took steps to make it painful not to progress. I sent my blog readers and friends an email asking them to join a mailing list that would remind them on a weekly basis to check whether I made 7 updates to my book that week. I specifically asked them to publically shame me on social media if I didn't make it, and to give me kind words if I managed.

This meant that writing this book was pleasureable and gave me a weekly boost of 'I made it!'. Likewise not updating my book with 7 times carried the pain of being judged by people I care about, my friends and readers.

There are many things to make your desired task easier, and not doing it too painful to consider. Find what makes you happy and make it a reward, find what makes you uncomfortable and make that a punishment.

## Dealing with procrastination

You know what happens when humans feel overwhelmed? We freeze. It's fight-flight mode from there. This leads to the common occurence of procrastination. But guess what, doing things later still means they are the same things.

The key to overcoming this is twofold:

- Break the problem down
- Start for 5 minutes

Breaking the problem down sounds simple but is incredibly powerful. Wanting to learn conversational Spanish can seem very overwhelming for example. But if you research your options you can find concrete ways of breaking down this problem. In this instance you might break it down into doing 1 lesson from the Michel Thomas series on Spanish a day.

The second is the most ridiculous superpower. For most people keeping going with a task is not all that hard, but starting is. If you find yourself shying away from a task tell yourself:

> I will do it for 5 minutes. If I don't want to keep going after I am allowed to stop.

Nine out of ten times those 5 minutes are all you need to get into a flow that will carry on for a good hour. This goes for work tasks, but also for example household tasks.

The last and final ingredient is to make procrastination tools unavailable. It is like the above paragraph on the path of least resistance. If you know that your house holds too many distractions, go to work in a cafe. If you are on social media a lot, get a browser plugin that blocks them during certain hours. Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong.

## How I found out

Throughout university I would often find myself naked and sweating preparing for tests. You see, 5 minutes from my house there was a new spa that was usually empty during the day. I had negotiated a favorable unlimited access deal with the owner and would come there often with printed out summaries of my courses. Studying for tests was incredibly relaxing. I'd rotate between sessions of Finnish sauna, cod plunge paths, whirlpools and reading the study materials for whatever test I was taking.

I had come to the conclusion that motivation shouldn't be hard per se. Sure there are mornings where you want to stay in bed, but progressing towards goals shouldn't be a struggle that makes you feel unhappy. Creating the path of least resistane for me meant eliminating distractions and making studying as easy as possible. To achieve that goal I tried to construct:

1. A distraction free study environment
2. Effective learning materials

The first came in the form of the sauna complex. No technology was allowed inside, so all I could bring were printed study materials. In addition the ambiance was one of silence and relaxation.

The learning materials was a different challenge. I knew I liked reading summaries, but did not like creating them as much. This hurdle was solved by splitting the burden of summaries amongst my fellow students.

The years prior to university has been a struggle of trial and error. Some of the things I tried to motivate myself worked well. I still attribute my drive to graduate highschool with good grades to a photoshopped copy of my diploma to be hanging in my room. Some things did not work as well, like taking a quick break to watch an episode of dr Who. Great show as it was, 10 minutes usually turned into an hour or more, and I didn't feel more motivated afterwards.

I soon learned that there were two aspects to motivating my personal psyche. Step one was getting started, step 2 was keeping going. I stopped looking at motivation as an external force, but rather saw it as a state you can create. It's like relaxation. Sure, sometimes it is easier to reach than others, but there are always actions you can take to reach that state.

This was for me the biggest turning point. Once I acknowledged that motivation was not a force that comes and goes but a choice, life became a lot easier. It also prompted me to read the writings of others who had written on the subject. Mostly this came down to bloggers and the odd book or two. Most of it was fluff, but the basic rules were similar in all of them.

At this point I feel in control of my own motivated state. That is not to say that I always manage to motivate myself to do things. But when I fail, I can trace back the cause very clearly and choose to take steps to prevent it from happening again.

An example of this is my daily exercise routine. It works great when I'm at home, but is harder to maintain when I travel. Nine out of ten times this is due to it being harder to get started. The excuses are easy. There is no space. I have to get to the next event. I'll do it later.

The solution is to simply look back at the principles. Create a path of least resistance and then follow it. In hotels that means that as soon as I get in I move around furniture so that there is space for pushups and handstands. When I feel resistance to get started I decide to do only half the workout. In the worst case some workout beats no workout, but usually I end up doing the full thing anyway once I get started.

You'd think that this is all quite a lot of work. But it doesn't take up all that much energy. It's actually the case that once you make sure you facilitate the right circumstances to get motivated, you expend less energy. Don't forget that failing to do what you want to do has an emotional price.
