# Hair and skin

Our current society puts value on the apprearance of skin and hair. 

### Collagen

The human skin is kept in shape by a scaffold made of a protein structure called collagen. This part of the 'extracellular matrix' gives skin elasticity and keeps it from wrinkling. Damage to the collagen structure is done by UVA radiation, which causes wrinkles. This is why dermatologists hammer on using sunscreen all day every day.

While preventing damage by means of sunscreen is good advice, is doesn't help your body to repair damage that is bound to occur because of daily sun exposure.

> Note that sun exposure is positive for many health factors, the downside to the positive effects is skin aging.

Intuitively it makes sense that if a certain structure in the body breaks down (collagen) you can stimulate growth by consuming more building blocks (in the form of said collagen). While the body it very cabable of conctructing collagen from other protein sources, consuming collagen as such seems to have positive effects on skin elasticity.

Studies have shown that radioactively labelled collagen (it's a harmless kind of study) can be traced to places in the body where collagen is present. A small placebo controlled study found that indeed consuming collagen increases skin elasticity after a few weeks.

Note that those looking to supplement collagen don't have to put up with dissolving regular collagen into hot water and drink a foul smelling mixture. There are great hydrolysed collagen supplements on the market that smell quite neutral and dissolve in cold water.
