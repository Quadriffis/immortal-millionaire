# Why this book

Nothing in this book is revealed here for the first time. I have spent years reading books, watching documentaries and listening to those smarter than I. Over time I discovered that the things I wanted to know were all out there in books or web pages. My issue was that everything was fragmented and over complicated.

This book attempts to structure the things I found in a way that is productive and effective for consumption. This is the book I wish I could have read years ago.
