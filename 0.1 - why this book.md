# Why this book

Nothing in this book is revealed here for the first time. I have spent years reading books, watching documentaries and listening to those smarter than I. Over time I discovered that the things I wanted to know were all out there in books or web pages. My issue was that everything was fragmented and over complicated.

This book attempts to structure the things I found in a way that is productive and effective for consumption. This is the book I wish I could have read years ago. A few of the tangible benefits that I achieved based on this information are:

- Productivity levels that scare some people
- Ability to re-program my habits with minimal effort
- A strong and flexible body with less effort than I thought possible
- A diet that optimised for cognitive performance and long life
- A clear roadmap of how I plan to retire before age 40
- Automated budget and investment systems that cause zero stress

I want to share these things with as many people as I can. The benefits I have received are beyond amazing and I wish them upon everyone.

Have fun and keep growing.
