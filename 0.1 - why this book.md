# Why this book

Nothing in this book is revealed here for the first time. I have spent years reading books, watching documantaries and listening to those smarter than me. Over time I discovered that the things I wanted to know were all out there in books or web pages. My issue was that everything was fragmented and over complicated.

This book attempts to structure the things I found in a way for productive and effective consumption. This is the book I wish I could have read in highschool.
