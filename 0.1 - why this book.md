# Why this book

I have spent years reading books, watching documentaries and listening to those smarter and more experienced than myself. I found that the things I wanted to know were already out there in books or web pages. For me the issue was that everything was fragmented and overly complicated.

This book attempts to structure and distill the things I found for effective consumption. I realise that some people will not like this book because it is more like a handbook than a story, and I'm ok with that. This is the book I wish I could have read years ago, and hopefully it will save some people a number of years of research.

A few of the tangible benefits that I achieved based on this information are:

- Productivity levels that scare some people
- Ability to re-program my habits with minimal effort
- A strong and flexible body with less effort than I thought possible
- A diet that optimised for cognitive performance and long life
- A clear roadmap of how I plan to retire before age 40
- Automated budget and investment systems that cause me zero stress

## This book is open source

I want to share these things with as many people as I can. The benefits I have received are beyond amazing and I wish them upon everyone.

Additionally, one of my major annoyances with buying ebooks is that when I want to quickly refer back to a specific passage I can't quickly do it online because online copies are deemed copyright infringement.

This is why a copy of this book is published under an open source license. This means that while you can buy the book, there is a free reference copy available  available on [Github](https://github.com/actuallymentor/immortal-millionaire/).

The online copy is released under the [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license. This means you can view the online reference version for free in a less user-friendly format than the ebook versions for sale. You may also share this free version so long as you don't charge money for it.

Have fun and keep growing.
