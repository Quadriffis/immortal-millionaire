# Live longer and healthier: blood tests and supplements

![Pills]( ./assets/2.5.2.jpg )

The body is a piece of complex machinery. While it runs very well on it's own, anyone serious about their health should be monitoring their internal health in a number of ways. By identifying problems before they do long term damage we can increase the joy we gain from life.

**Principles for blood testing & supplementation**

1. Do not supplement blindly
2. Test for common deficiencies
3. Test for predictive markers
4. Consider health supporting supplements

**In this chapter**

- Recommended blood tests to get
- How supplements can be very harmful when used wrongly
- The importance of recent research data
- Common and unusual supplements you can consider taking

## Do not supplement blindly

Many people seem intent on using supplements blindly. It is in most developed countries however trivial to get a blood panel that tests for useful values.

Supplements should be exactly what the name implies, supplemental consumptions. They are not designed to replace a varied diet that supplies the nutrients your body needs. They can however offer ways to:

- Correct deficiencies
- Offer benefits that regular foods do not

Don't blindly take supplements:

1. Get your blood tested
2. Make a game plan (supplements/food)
3. Test again a few weeks later

Note however that blood tests are not like opening the door to a room to see what is inside. You can't just "test your blood" and expect a list of results to come back. You need to test for specific things. You can't just go by statistics, as they can be deceiving. If for example 50% of a population is deficient in vitamin B12, that might convince you to take the supplement. If the underlying data however shows that the 50% that has this issue is over 65 years old, you may or may not change your standpoint.

For each of the things you test for there is probably a different test that needs to be run on your blood. It is therefore vital to know what you want to test for. Also keep in mind that the unit of measurement sometimes differs per lab. If you are used to get your levels of a marker being something like 2.5 and suddenly they are 200, ask your doctor what unit the test was done in. Often They switched labs and went from one standard (e.g. mmol/L) to another (g/L). You can find conversion tools online, or can ask your doctor to help you standardise the results.

### The harm of supplements

Vitamin supplements are not without risk. Many people approach it with a "worst case it doesn't do anything" attitude. The thing is that excess vitamins too can upset the balance of your body.

The B vitamin group for example is well known to stimulate certain types of growth. This is why people take it to make nails and hair grow faster/stronger. Hypothetically however these supplements could hypothetically stimulate the growth of undesirable cells like tumours as well. Some studies suggest excessive B6 and B12 supplementation could increase lung cancer risk for example[^See [Long-Term, Supplemental, One-Carbon Metabolismâ€“Related Vitamin B Use in Relation to Lung Cancer Risk in the Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) Cohort](http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2017.72.7735?journalCode=jco)]. This doesn't mean b vitamins are bad, but it might indicate that taking them blindly can be problematic.

Likewise for many male consumers taking extra iron is a terrible idea and has shown to increase risk for some disease, whereas this is less so the case for women (who lose iron through menstruation).

> Don't get me wrong: no supplement is inherently good or bad

Blindly taking highly concentrated supplements is a terrible idea though. Test yourself first.

## Test for common deficiencies

When it comes to blood tests, note that not all values are immediately useful. Cholesterol values for example are not all that useful for many young people. Having some baseline readings however can be valuable in future scenarios. There are a number of values that are interesting to test that are not per definition related to dietary deficiencies.

On a statistical basis there are a number of supplements that could benefit a great many people, and you should get yourself tested for the levels in your system. Depending on your location and environment it may pay off to do tests for things like heavy metals. Ask your doctor what values might be interesting for your particular situation, genetics and environment.

I recommend asking your doctor for the original lab notes of your tests and keeping a spreadsheet of your tested values. Often a doctor will only tell you 'everything looked fine' without sharing the actual values. This is perfectly normal since most people have no desire to know about the specifics. By asking for the lab for the original notes you can observe trends and when needed show the results to a specialist you might have to see in the future. My doctor usually has the assistant email me scanned copies of the lab note which I back up and record in a spreadsheet.

The following section discusses some commonly recommended tests.

### Iron

This is often associated with low energy levels. In fact the past year I've been perpetually frustrated by an advertisement in the London metro that recommends an iron rich drink for people who feel tired. While low iron can make you tired, being tired doesn't mean you have low iron.

In fact, excess iron can potentially cause a host of problems from cardiovascular disease to cancer[^See [Moderate elevation of body iron level and increased risk of cancer occurrence and death](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/9789812813688_0045)]. There is a big difference of iron needs between the sexes as well, since women periodically lose iron through menstruation and men don't. Iron should be tested for, but never taken as a supplement unless a deficiency is found. Especially men should avoid multivitamins with iron in them.

When testing for iron you will likely be confronted with the following terms, which I'll explain in simplified terms:

- **Transferrin** is a protein used for iron transport in the blood. It transports iron from the intestines (food) to the cells. Serum iron is a measure for the amount of circulating iron that is bound to transferrin.
-  **Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)** is the amount of iron your body is capable of binding using transferrin.
- **Iron/transferrin saturation** is a measure of the amount of transferrin that is currently being used to hold iron.
- **Ferritin** is an iron storage (and to a lesser degree transport) protein that buffers against having harmful high or low levels or free iron. It is used as an indirect measure for the amount of iron in the body.
- **Hemoglobin (Hb)** is sometimes reported under iron tests and sometimes under hemotology

Proteins like transferrin and ferritin have more functions than described here (e.g. immune function) but for the sake or your iron test those are not essential to understand.

### Vitamin D

Vitamin d is a steroid hormone. That is to say that this substance has the ability to reach the cell nucleus (where the DNA is kept) and influence what genes are expressed. In other words: vitamin d changes what part of your DNA is on and off.

Humans have two main sources of vitamin d:

- Food
- The sun

Foods high in vitamin d include for example fatty fish. One stereotypical example is cod liver oil.

Our skin is able to generate vitamin d from sunlight as well. The problem there is that in the recent parts of human existence we've spent a lot of time indoors and covering 90% of our skin surface area with sun blocking clothing.

Some common reasons for low vitamin d levels include:

- Sitting inside all day
- Having darker skin in countries with less sun
- Wearing clothing that covers a lot of skin

The effects of low vitamin d can be manifold (remember, it affects DNA expression):

- Lower mood levels
- Suboptimal immune function
- Suboptimal cognitive function
- Weaker bone and teeth

When buying vitamin d supplements after having your blood tested, ask your doctor what is a good dose for you. It is important to know your target level. Consult with your doctor but do point out that:

-  There is research indicating that the optimal level for a reduction of all cause mortality is 100-150 nmol/L (equivalent 40-60 ng/ml)[^See  [Meta-analysis of all-cause mortality according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922127)].
- From research it appears to be the case that a vitamin d supplement[^See [Vitamin D: Deficiency, Sufficiency and Toxicity, section 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3798924/#__sec5title)]
	- Of 1000-2000 IU (equivalent of 25-50 mcg) raises levels in the blood by 5-10 ng/L (equivalent 12.5-25 nmol/L) depending on the study
	- It seems to take about 6 weeks for the supplement to be reflected in blood levels
	- There are indications taking 2000IU/day or 50000IU/week have the same effect
	- Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the best form to take for humans as a supplement

### Magnesium

This mineral is used in a large amount of functions ranging from the immune system to the brain. It's used by 300+ enzymes and without it our primary ATP based cellular energy system would not function. There are no international population wide statistics on magnesium levels in the blood, but depending on what study you look at as many as 60% to 80% of people are deficient in magnesium.

The problem is twofold:

> Many people don't consume enough magnesium, and magnesium supplements are often bad

The issue with magnesium supplements is that different types are absorbed better or worse. Not only that, but it appears that different types are preferred by certain organs.

The important magnesium types to know:

| Type | Bioavailability | Notes |
| --- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Magnesium Oxide | Extremely low | Basically magnesium rust, can cause diarrhoea. |
| Magnesium Citrate | Good | Cost effective, mild laxative in higher dosages. |
| Magnesium Gluconate & Glycinate | Good | Harder to find, more expensive. Unpleasant taste in powder form. |
| Magnesium Lactate | Excellent  | Harder to find, dissolves well into liquids. I like it in tea. |

You can check for the type of magnesium in your supplement by checking the ingredient list.

## Test for predictive markers

Our understanding of predicting disease risks changes very rapidly. Based on that you should keep in mind that:

- The information in this book might be incomplete by the time you read it
- Your doctor may not be up to date on the latest research

In practice that means that you should open a dialogue with your doctor about what tests could be useful for someone with your personal health profile and family history. If you doubt that your doctor knows about the latest research, ask them about their efforts to stay up to date. If they are not willing to work with you on a preventive approach, consider switching doctors.

Personally I have experienced that doctors in bigger cities tend to be more up to date and flexible. This will be very dependent on the healthcare system in your country.

### Homocysteine

Homocysteine is an amino acid that is not obtained through diet, it is an element the cycle that handles methionine and cysteine which are both amino acids as well. Converting homocysteine to methionine and cysteine depends heavily on vitamins B 2,6,12 and folate[^See the [Folate wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate#DNA_and_amino_acid_production) and [homocysteine wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homocysteine#Biosynthesis_of_cysteine)].

The data on homocysteine and health seems contradictive:

- **Cardiovascular risk** is higher for people with higher homocysteine levels[^See [Homocysteine and Familial Longevity: The Leiden Longevity Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0017543) and (Plasma Homocysteine Levels and Mortality in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease)[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199707243370403]].
- **Cancer risk** is higher for people with elevated homocysteine levels[^See [Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for cancer and a new potential tumor marker](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898102001742)].
- Lowering homocysteine directly by supplementing with folate **does not** seem to have benefits for cardiovascular or cancer risk[^See [Effects of Lowering Homocysteine Levels With B Vitamins on Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer, and Cause-Specific Mortality](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/226081)]
- Randomised trials report positive effects for a combination of folate, B6 and B12 for those who have undergone certain cardiovascular surgeries[^See [Effect of Homocysteine-Lowering Therapy With Folic Acid, Vitamin B12, and Vitamin B6 on Clinical Outcome After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/195230)]
- Higher than RDA amounts of folate and B6 combined seem to reduce cardiovascular risk in women[^See [Folate and Vitamin B6 From Diet and Supplements in Relation to Risk of Coronary Heart Disease Among Women](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187209)]

So, elevated homocysteine predicts issues. Lowering homocysteine seems to not do much. Based on that data there are a number of possible conclusions:

- Elevated homocysteine is the symptom of an (unknown) underlying problem
- The research done is not using the right typed/doses of vitamins

Either way, until better research is done getting your homocysteine tested is interesting as a health indicator even if we're not sure how to fix it if it's high.

#### The MTHFR gene

There is a particular gene that is important for the processing of homocysteine through the folate cycle. This gene is called "Methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase" or MTHFR for short. There are a number of versions of this gene in humans. If you have a variant called 677TT you will have severely reduced activity if the MTHFR enzyme which results in elevated homocysteine levels. Mutations in this gene potentially increase the risk of  schizophrenia[^See [Meta-Analysis of All Published SZ Association Studies (Case-Control Only) rs1801133](https://www.webcitation.org/66LAg9Kuk?url=http://www.szgene.org/meta.asp?geneID=4)], dementia[^See [Apolipoprotein E, Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) Mutation and the Risk of Senile Dementia -An Epidemiological Study Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Method](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jea1991/10/3/10_3_163/_article)] and myocardial infarction[^See [C667T and A1298C polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene and susceptibility to myocardial infarction: A systematic review and meta-analysis](http://www.internationaljournalofcardiology.com/article/S0167-5273\(16\)30889-0/fulltext)].

### Hba1c (glycated hemoglobin)

Red blood cells interact with glucose in the blood, hence glycated (glucose modified) hemoglobin (red blood cell component). Because red blood cells have a life span of on average 120 days we can use hba1c to estimate the average blood glucose levels of the blood in the past 3 months.

By proxy we can use this measure to estimate how well the body controls blood sugar levels. It is usually applied to diabetics to get a more long term overview of blood sugar control compared to a fasting blood sugar test which could be influenced by many short term variables.

While this test is commonly used for diabetics, studies suggest that it is also a health predictor in healthy non-diabetic populations. Elevated levels of Hba1c seem to correlate with increased mortality from all-causes, and specifically cardiovascular and cancer risk [^See [Hyperglycaemia is associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the Hoorn population: the Hoorn Study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s001250051249) and [Relationship between HbA1c and mortality in a Japanese population](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-004-1643-9)]. A 2010 study that followed 14099 individuals for 20 years found that even when the results were compensated for a large number of other variables (age, race-ethnicity, sex, lifestyle, cardiovascular factors, metabolic factors, red blood cell indices, iron storage indices, and liver function indices) they still indicated that elevated Hba1c levels correlated with higher mortality. A smaller 2017 study found similar results [^See [The Impact of Diabetes Mellitus and Corresponding HbA1c Levels on the Future Risks of Cardiovascular Disease and Mortality: A Representative Cohort Study in Taiwan](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0123116)]. Additionally, a larger (24752 participants) study found that lowering Hba1c using a diabetics drug lowered cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk[^ See [Early Glycemic Control and Magnitude of HbA1c Reduction Predict Cardiovascular Events and Mortality: Population-Based Cohort Study of 24,752 Metformin Initiators](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/40/6/800)].

As always I must stress that these are observational studies, meaning we don't fully understand _why_ Hba1c is correlated with higher mortality rates. What we do know is that is can be used to measure how well your body regulates blood sugar levels, and that high blood sugar levels are predictive of a host of health issues.

If your Hba1c is elevated, consult your doctor and take a long hard look at your eating and exercise habits. Particularly the glycemic load you are putting on your body.

### Lipid panel (cholesterol etc)

A lipid panel tests cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The understanding of science has changed quite a bit in the past years. Particularly with regards to cholesterol. The first important thing to understand is that the body relies greatly on fats and cholesterol for optimal function. The human brain is almost 60% fats (excluding water)[^See [Essential fatty acids and human brain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20329590)] and contains a lot of cholesterol as well. Cholesterol makes up about 30% of our cell membranes to keep them fluid (read: flexible)[^See [the cholesterol wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol#Function)]. The second important thing is that when a doctor talks about your cholesterol they are not talking about the cholesterol as you find it in food. In the blood cholesterol exists mostly incorporated into larger complexes like LDL and HDL.

Your test will probably come back with the following categories:

- **Total cholesterol** - this value reflects your absolute cholesterol levels and does not make a distinction between types. Lower is not better! Indiscriminately demonising cholesterol is a grave mistake on our society's part, low cholesterol is for example a factor for having _more_ heart failure Low serum total cholesterol is associated with marked increase in mortality in advanced heart failure[^See [Low serum total cholesterol is associated with marked increase in mortality in advanced heart failure](http://www.onlinejcf.com/article/S1071-9164\(02\)00018-0/abstract)].
- **LDL** - or Low Density Lipoprotein is a combination of fats, protein and cholesterol. It is a vehicle in the blood used to transport fats and cholesterol to cells that need them. The 'low' in LDL refers to is being less dense and more 'fluffy' if you will. There are many classes of LDL like ultra/very/intermediate/low density lipoprotein (respectively ULDL, vLDL, IDL, LDL). While research on these types is being done plenty, most countries still bunch them together on the same pile (LDL) when it comes to the medical system.
- **HDL** - or High Density Lipoprotein is similar to LDL but are more dense (less 'fluffy'). Where LDL transports fats and cholesterol _to_ cells HDL transports it _away_ from cells. Together they form the supply and drainage of lipids and cholesterol. HDL is often called 'good' cholesterol since people with excess LDL need HDL to balance it out, this is obviously inaccurate since balancing two things doesn't mean one is good or bad.
- **Triglycerides** - are what is colloquial speech we call fats. Olive oil is mostly triglycerides and your body stores fat as triglycerides. On a biochemical level they are a head of glycerol with three tails of fatty acids.
- **Total:HDL ratio** - this is a measure of how much HDL there is in the blood relative to other cholesterol types. It is far more predictive of mortality risk than absolute cholesterol or LDL numbers. So far it appears to be the best simple lipid based marker we have[^See [Importance of LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio as a predictor for coronary heart disease events in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia: a 15-year follow-up](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1185/0300799039117034) and [Association of Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Cholesterol/ HDL and Triglyceride with All-Cause Mortality in Life Insurance Applicants](https://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/20666103)].

What should you do it any of these markers are out of whack? First, listen to your doctor of course. But equally important is to follow recent science. As a general rule the following are true:

- Eating saturated fats is not per se a risk factor for cardiovascular disease
- Eating cholesterol is not per se a risk factor for cardiovascular disease
- Eating low glycemic index/load foods (especially sugars) is

If you want to know why many countries still believe a low fat and low cholesterol diet prevents cardiovascular disease please read [my summary on the history of cholesterol research](https://www.skillcollector.com/post/history-of-cholesterol-research/) or watch [this excellent 80 minute presentation](https://peterattiamd.com/how-did-we-come-to-believe-saturated-fat-and-cholesterol-are-bad-for-us/) on it by dr Peter Attia. If you like deep science, look at this [in depth blog series](https://peterattiamd.com/the-straight-dope-on-cholesterol-part-i/) he wrote.

### Testosterone

Humans are sensitive to testosterone levels for a number of physical and mental issues. Low testosterone in both men and women can manifest as fatigue, depression, trouble concentrating and sexual dysfunction.

In a study of older men (50+) testosterone levels were correlated with increased risk of death, even when other factors like age, body fat and lifestyle were taken into account[^See [Low Serum Testosterone and Mortality in Older Men](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/93/1/68/2598158)]. Preliminary studies confirm that testosterone therapy in older men reduces the mortality effects of low testosterone[^See [Testosterone Treatment and Mortality in Men with Low Testosterone Levels](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/97/6/2050/2536693)]. A German study on females ages 18-75 also found that low testosterone was associated with increased all-cause mortality [^See [Low testosterone levels predict all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in women: a prospective cohort study in German primary care patients](http://www.eje-online.org/content/163/4/699.short)].

Low testosterone have been found to be associated with the well-being, mood and sexual function of both men[^See [Testosterone replacement therapy for hypogonadal men with SSRI-refractory depression](http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327\(97\)00168-7/abstract), [Bioavailable Testosterone and Depressed Mood in Older Men: The Rancho Bernardo Study](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/84/2/573/2864323) and [Testosterone and Depression in Aging Men](http://www.ajgponline.org/article/S1064-7481\(12\)61179-8/abstract)] as well as women[^See [Transdermal testosterone therapy improves well-being, mood, and sexual function in premenopausal women](https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/Abstract/2003/10050/Transdermal_testosterone_therapy_improves.4.aspx) and [The impact of testosterone imbalance on depression and women's health](http://www.maturitas.org/article/S0378-5122\(02\)00013-0/abstract)], though in women abnormally high levels have been shown to be associated with depression as well.

### Complete blood count

The complete blood count (CBC) checks the levels of a number of blood cells, proteins and other values. It is a generalised test often used as a general health check. By looking at the different types of cells (e.g. red, white, platelets) and markers (e.g. hemoglobin) in the blood your doctor can estimate the overall functions of a large number of systems. Rather than being a specific diagnosis if something in this panel is off your doctor will probably suggest more targeted tests to find out what is wrong.

## Consider health supporting supplements

There are a number of supplements that have the potential to support a good quality of life, or to extend lifespan potentially. Many of these are quite experimental and have only proven to work in theory or on animal models. I list them here as interesting options to explore if you have taken care of the basics, I do not explicitly recommend taking them.

### Lithium Ororate (mental health/mood)

Lithium is associated in high dosages with the treatment of psychiatric disorders. It is however in low dosages an essential mineral for optimal health. It occurs naturally in low dosages (up to 0.170 mg/L in tap water). The argument has been made in a New York Times article [should we all take a bit of lithium?](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/opinion/sunday/should-we-all-take-a-bit-of-lithium.html) that we could all benefit from a low dosage of lithium on a daily basis. Suicide rates appear to be lower in areas where there is more lithium naturally in the drinking water for example. From an older study from (1994) using a dose of 400 Î¼g/d:

> "... mental and physical activity, ability to think and work, mood, and emotionality. In the lithium group, the total mood test scores increased steadily and significantly during the period of supplementation" [^See [Effects of nutritional lithium supplementation on mood](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02916824)].

From a more recent 2001 study:

> ... low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates ... a provisional RDA for a 70 kg adult of 1000 Î¼g/day is suggested [^ See [Lithium: Occurrence, Dietary Intakes, Nutritional Essentiality](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2002.10719188)]

Epidemiological studies also find a tentative correlation between low dose lithium intakes and longevity in humans and other animal species[^See [Low-dose lithium uptake promotes longevity in humans and metazoans](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-011-0171-x)]. Research continues on the role of lithium in preventing suicide, mania, ageing, dementia and cancer[^See [Is lithium potentially a trace element?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369538/)].

While large therapeutic dosages are classified as medicine (and rightfully so) the smaller dosed supplements are available for purchase from many supplement vendors. The dosages are greatly smaller than those in the medical form. Do not exceed low dosages in an attempt to self-medicate, enough tabs of a low dose supplement will land you in the medical zone. See [this case study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03160910) of an 18 year old who thought more is better.

### Collagen (skin/joints)

The human skin is kept in shape by a scaffold made of a protein structure called collagen. This part of the 'extracellular matrix' gives skin elasticity and keeps it from wrinkling. Likewise it is an important structural component in cartilage that keeps our joints running smoothly.

Damage to the collagen structure in skin is done by UV radiation, which causes wrinkles. This is why dermatologists hammer on using sunscreen all day every day. While preventing damage by means of sunscreen is good advice, is doesn't help your body to repair damage that is bound to occur because of daily sun exposure. Note that sun exposure is positive for many health factors, the downside to the positive effects is skin ageing.

Intuitively it makes sense that if a certain structure in the body breaks down (collagen) you can stimulate growth by consuming more building blocks (in the form of said collagen). Some argue that the body is perfectly capable of producing collagen if sufficient protein is consumed, but recent data seems to counteract this view. While the body is very capable of constructing collagen from other protein sources, consuming collagen as such seems to have positive effects on skin elasticity and joint health.

Studies have shown that radioactively labelled collagen derivatives can be traced to places in the body where collagen has a functional presence, like skin and cartilage[^See [Distribution of Prolylhydroxyproline and Its Metabolites after Oral Administration in Rats](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bpb/35/3/35_3_422/_article)]. Further placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that supplementation with collagen peptides improved skin hydration and increased collagen density in the skin [^See [The effect of oral collagen peptide supplementation on skin moisture and the dermal collagen network: evidence from an ex vivo model and randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.12174/full)].

A double-blind placebo controlled study also found that collagen supplementation (specifically undenatured type II collagen) decreased pain and stiffness in people suffering from knee osteoarthritis. It was found to be more effective than the often used regimen of glucosamine and chondroitin at very low dosages of 20-40 mg/day[^See [Efficacy and tolerability of an undenatured type II collagen supplement in modulating knee osteoarthritis symptoms: a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-016-0130-8) and [Safety and efficacy of undenatured type II collagen in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee: a clinical trial](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2764342/)]. A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study looking at athletes with joint pain found significant improvements in joint pain when walking, standing, at rest, carrying weight and lifting weight with 10 grams of hydrolysed collagen per day[^See [24-Week study on the use of collagen hydrolysate as a dietary supplement in athletes with activity-related joint pain](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1185/030079908x291967)].

Note that those looking to supplement collagen don't have to put up with dissolving regular collagen (gelatine) into hot water and drink a foul smelling mixture. There are great hydrolysed collagen supplements on the market that smell quite neutral and dissolve in cold water.

### Fish oil (omega 3's)

Fish oil is known as a beneficial supplement in pop culture. The effects that are often touted include their beneficial effect on the cardiovascular system and cholesterol levels. More and more research however seems to indicate that omega 3 fatty acids also have many benefits for neurological attributes like cognitive function and mood levels.

For this supplement it is important to realise that fatty acids are essential for the structure and functioning of cells. In essence human cells are bags of water, filled with molecular machinery (DNA, mitochondria etc). The 'bag' that is the border of the cell basically uses lipids as an important building block. The right lipids keep the cell membrane flexible and functioning optimally. This is very important for many things, including nerve function.

On supplement bottles you will often find references to EPA and DHA. These are two forms of omega 3 fatty acids. Their structure differs and research indicates that their effect differs as well.

If you plan to take fish oil on a long term basis make sure that you choose a reputable supplement that is adequately purified. The fish used to produce the oil may contain toxins like heavy metals (especially if the source fish is high up the food chain) that need to be filtered out.

With regards to toxins and oil quality it pays off to look for products that:

- Are produced from animals low on the food chain (e.g. herring instead of salmon)
- Are filtered well (everybody claims this so it is harder to test)
- Has lab tests available on their website

## Recommendations for supplements

Note: For all deficiencies ask your doctor if there is a reason you would have lower levels due to a reason other that low intake. B12 levels can also for example be low due to malabsorption.

| Supplement | Recommendation |

## Getting started

The most important thing is to simply get started and to plan in periodic measurements. Often this means going to your doctor, explaining what you want to test, and getting blood drawn. In my experience it is of prime importance to 1) ask your doctor for a copy of the original lab notes and 2) not to let them dismiss you.

The fact of the matter is that doctors are in most cases not used to dealing with those of us who want to keep a detailed eye on your health markers. After every blood test session I receive an email from my doctor's assistant saying "we found nothing out fo the ordinary" to which I always reply "thank you for your email, would you be so kind as to send me a copy of the original lab notes?". I recommend making digital backups of your lab notes and if you like spreadsheets input the data into one.

The second hurdle when it comes to doctors not being used to people like us is that they will often instinctively dismiss us. This is not bad will, but simply structured and somewhat rigid thinking. Expect to hear your doctor say "you don't need to test Hba1c, that is for diabetics" or "you are far to young to start testing cholesterol" and my personal favourite "you only need to start testing vitamin d once you exhibit symptoms, and you look fine". Stay calm, but don't take no for an answer. Be clear in that you are not doing this on a whim but based on the latest research and offer to send them the research if they would like (send them a copy of this chapter, or some of the studies linked in it). If all else fails, switch doctor's since this one doesn't seem to value preventative healthcare principles.

Once you are comfortable asking your doctor for tests, most people have two important considerations when it comes to custom blood testing: availability and cost.

The first is usually a function of the healthcare system in your country. In the Netherlands I am able to simply book an appointment with my doctor through their online booking system and get my blood drawn while I'm there. From friends I know that the ease of access differs greatly per country and even within countries. I recommend booking a session with your doctor to explain that you are starting to gather preventative data about your health status. Ask them if this is something they are able to supply or if you need to contact private laboratories, in most developed countries your doctor should be able to help you. Make it clear that you have researched your options and in a very targeted fashion are looking to 1) spot and correct deficiencies and 2) monitor well established long term health markers.

For the matter of cost you will once again be dependent on the system in your country, and in addition how you are making use of it. In the Netherlands every citizen is insured for health cost with a minimum 'pay it yourself' amount of about â‚¬300-400. In practice this means that the first couple of hundred of tests will fall on you personally, and after that the insurance pays everything. I recommend checking in detail what your insurance covers and does not cover. In some cases it may pay off to go to a private lab (which you can find on Google) instead of your doctor since it can be cheaper. Then again, your insurance may cover the tests your doctor clears but not the ones you decide to get on your own.

In most cases I recommend just going to your doctor and talking to them about options. If the cost in your country is prohibitively high (looking at you US) consider doing some medical tourism. If you plan to go abroad to a cheaper country, you may consider finding a trustworthy lab that can do the tests at a fraction of the cost.

To summarise:

1. Get your doctor on board
2. Check cost and availability
3. Collect the lab notes (optionally record them in a spreadsheet)
4. Book periodic sessions

## How I found out

In winters I very reliably have a decline in overall mood. My mother used to refer to it as my 'winter dip'. I remember a year where things were particularly bad. It's not that I would be what is classically described as depressed, but every system in my body and mind would experience a loss of vividness. I was tired, lethargic and experienced the world as 'fuzzy'.

The year that had a particularly intense dip my mother sent me to our family doctor. The man was when you would imagine an average general practitioner to be like. Male, middle aged, not in shape, not out of shape, small round glasses and a calm but not intimidating authority. He also had no clue what to do. To him I was just a moody teenager who was going through the natural cycle of hormonal changes and development.

Knowing what I know now, he could have helped me find my energetic self with a few reasonably simple actions. Starting with some diagnostic questions:

- How much and how well do you sleep?
- What do you eat?
- How physically active are you?
- When are you likely to feel good/bad?
- Do you have any other mental challenges?

The answers would have made health recommendations quite easy:

- I go to bed late and get up early, total sleep time 6-8 hours
- A lot. Mostly carbs. Candy and soda are a daily occurrence
- I am a competitive athlete and practice 5 to 7 days a week
- Every winter I have my winter dip
- I have intense panic attacks a few times a year and my parents fight often.

Even based on those it is quite obvious what to recommend to a sleep deprived teenager who is putting high strain on their bodies while in an episode of seasonal affective disorder.

The torturous months I lived through would have been easily improved with basic evidence based recommendations:

- Sleep 8+ hours, teenagers have increased sleep needs compared to adults
- Reduce or eliminate low glycemic index carbohydrates from your diet
- Give your body time to recover from your sports performance, rotate intense/easy sports days
- Test for vitamin d levels and supplement to bring them up. Also suggest increasing daylight exposure.
- Suggest stress resilience treatment (meditation, breathing exercises, psychologist, etc)

Instead of that happening I suffered through this period and took a good year to get out of this particularly intense dip. On the plus side, this experience led me to do my own research. Since my doctor seemed not to grasp the intensity of my suffering, I turned to the internet.

If you think the internet is full of conflicting information now, imagine what it was like in the early 2000s. One of my primary information sources was the information section of a sports nutrition producer. This has the predictable effect that they talked me into buying and taking pretty much everything they had on offer. I spent all my pocket money on pills, powders and liquids.

Looking back at that time I was very fortunate since the company actually produced high quality products. Many  years later I met the owner and worked for them for a while. While their motivations were undoubtedly financial, this phase of experimentation taught me to think of the human body as a machine that operates based on set rules.

The cycle I went through with supplements at the time was 1) read about a supplement 2) get excited about the science 3) use the supplement and 4) decide whether or not it worked for me. The most valuable part of the whole process was learning that I found the biology of the human body and what food/supplementation do to it very exciting.

Keep in mind that at this time I was in high school and had nowhere near the sophistication to read scientific studies. The 'science' I did back then was mostly reading watered down science journalism and supplement labels. Only in the years after that did university teach me the more in-depth mechanisms of homeostasis and the art of reading the results of scientific studies.

An interesting turning point for me was when I heard the at the time terms _evidence based medicine_, _preventive healthcare_ and _personalised healthcare_. Imagine my confusion. I had alway assumed my doctor's goal was to keep me healthy and to help me tackle the specific health challenges I faced. As it turns out, the global healthcare system is not geared towards that. Healthcare turned out to mean sickcare, the care of the sick. Additionally, many doctors operate not on the latest research, but on what they learned in school decades ago. When you get ill, most likely your doctor doesn't see you 'the patient' but rather a disease without the context of the person it is affecting.

The current system is certainly better than nothing, but advances in genetics and other recent developments are changing the game. We are learning that some drugs work well for some people, and that lifestyle is one of the most powerful facilitators of health. Most doctors are not ready for this. I remember the first time I brought my genetics report (done through [23andme](https://www.23andme.com)) to my doctor. They treated me like a child who made a drawing and wanted a sticker for their efforts.

Since then I have decided to take ownership of my health. I trust my doctors, but challenge them if I find reliable research that contradicts their views. I expect the world's healthcare systems to change a lot the coming years with the increased accessibility of genetics testing and better understanding of preventive testing. Until my health is the job of a super intelligent artificial intelligence I will continue to spend time and energy on being responsible for my own health.
