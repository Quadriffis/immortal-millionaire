# Develop flexibility

Imagine the feeling of taking off a tight and constraining piece of clothing, and the freedom that comes with it. For many people their body is like a contrant constraining factor, and because they have never known anything else they think it's normal. Developing flexibility feels like taking off a suit that has had you contrained for years. The freedom of being able to move your body is a type of freedom most people have never known.

**Principles for flexibility**

1. Choose stretching routines that target many and large muscle groups
1. Treat stretching as normal length workouts
1. Stick with intense stretch workouts for at least 6-12 months
1. Consider Gymnastics Strength Training (GST)

## FLexibility vs mobility

While strength and stamina receive a lot of attention in pop culture the attribute of mobility is not as prominent.

- Flexibility refers to the ability to stretch into certain positions
- Mobility refers to being able to stretch while maintaining strength

Flexibility tends to be static whereas the goal of mobility is to be able to use the body to move comfortable through physical motions. Their training should go hand in hand.

Optimally the human body should be able to move in any number of ways that are in our society anything but standard. Many people are not even able to touch their toes while keeping their legs straight.

## Target many and large muscle groups

For most people tension is most severe and problematic in larger muscle groups. For example hamstrings, quadriceps and the lower back. Of course there are many other problematic areas like the calves and neck.

Often there are exercises that can target large and multiple muscle groups at once. For example pancake work when executed correctly can stretch the back, hamstrings and calves. Favor these kinds of exerxises over very specific movements.

**My favorite stretches**

I do these stretches every day. They keep my main points of flexibility in shape but must be supplemented with more whole-body stretch workouts.

- Pancake (leaning forward)
- Pancake (body flat on leg)
- Straddle side stretch
- Achilles stretch (leaning on one foot)
- Glute stretch
- Elevated bridge
- Knees by ears (rolled on your back)

**General advice**

- Stretching should be uncomfortable, but not painful
- Connective tissue grows and heals slowly, give it time
- Injuries of connective tissue take a long time to heal, don't overdo intensity
- Stretching isn't about relaxing, actively engage your muscles
- Any stretching beats no stretching, make it a daily routine

## Treat stretching as normal length workouts

Exercise is something we use to give our bodies a signal for what development we desire. In the case of weight lifting we are saying 'our muscles are not developed enough for this task, please develop them'. In the case of muscles the body will activate synthesis pathways for muscle development.

With flexibility and mobility work we need to give an equaly strong signal that we want to develop connective tissue and muscle relaxation. To that effect we need to take exercising for flexibility as seriously as muscle development.

## Horizon: 6-12 months

Connective tissue develops much slower than muscle, meaning that you will notice that:

- Flexibility develops slowly as connective tissue changes over weeks and months
- Your range of motion often ends up being 'stuck' for a while, and then suddely develops dramatically seemingly over night

The upside to this is that once developed it takes a lot less effort to maintain flexibility and mobility.

## Gymnastics strength training

Personally I have had great experiences with the GST approach, specifically the fundamentals 1 series. It takes principles from gymnastics and translates them into gym-friendly workouts that increase your flexibility and mobility hand in hand.

The program is quite insense though and for a good few months had me doing daily workouts. The results are astonishing and I highly recommend this program to anyone who takes developing flexibility and mobility seriously.

If anything this program is a good way to go from your current level to the level you desire to achieve. I found doing a workout every day unfeasable for me personally, but highly recommend following the program for as long as needed to get to your desired level. After that you can institute maintenance routines.

Some observations:

- You will need some special equipment (that is available in most gyms or cheap to get)
- Some exercises require things like gymnastics rings. I ended up using whatever was a close to the instruction video that was available in my gym

## How I became 'the flexible guy'

Flexibility has never been my strong suit. My friends in highschool all assumed I was flexible because I did trampolineing, presumably because they thought it was like gymnastics. The reality was though that touching my toes with my legs straight has been hard or impossible for me at different times in my life.

As I started feeelancing and developing a professional carreer I started being plagued by back and neck pain. I later found out back issues are prevalent in both my mother and fathers families to different degrees.

I remember one incident where I was sitting against a wall cross legged when suddenly - boom! - my back exploded in excruciating pain. For a good 3 days walking hurt, getting dressed hurt and pretty much everything other than lying flat hurt (and even that a little).

As any sane person would I visited a physiotherapist specialising in back pain within days of being able to walk again. He looked at me, had me do some postures and proclaimed we'd get things fixed in no time. Two times a week I visited the practice and was guided through a number of exercises.

Most of the exercises though focused on strength and joints:

- Deadlift motions withoug weight
- Lifting arms and legs on all fours
- Bending the back on all fours
- And so on

While I did start to feel better, I could feel that my back was not doing ok. From the way my muscles felt during the exercises I concluded that my hamstrings and core muscles were very tight.

Of course I followed the advice of my fysiotherapist, but could not resist reading some books on the topic of flexibility, mobility and injury proofing.

Through this search I found a book called Becoming a Supple Leopard which pulled into question most things I knew about how a body should move. This book told me all the sensical things that no gym coach or therapist had articulated to me. From body posture under stress to flexibility with relaxed muscles being a wrong approach.

Meanwhile I started trying all sorts of flexibility approaches, from the things I found in books to daily yoga classes at six in the morning.

I started to put these practices to use, but still nothing really clicked. That is until I found out about a Coach Christopher Sommer. A former US national gymnastics coach with strong and unconventional views on what a normal healthy human body should be able to do.

He extrapolated his gymnastics philosophy into a set of workout routines designed to help both couch potatos and inflexible muscleheads to develop strong flexibility. Coach Sommer doesn't believe in strength and flexibility being isolated properties of the body. His workouts are designed for what he calls mobility, the application of strength in all relevant angles.

I started his gymnastics strength training series called Foundation and Stretch. These two had me in the gym multiple times a week for a good hour doing all sorts of stretches and strenth exercises.

In the beginning the whole thing was pure torture. Every 45 minute workout had me miserable. What kept me going is that after the actual workout, my body felt absolutely wonderful. For the first few weeks I seemed not to progress at all. Then suddenly one day I was able to touch my toes.

Another few weeks passed without progress. Then seemingly out of the blue I had no issue whatsoever bringing my face to my knee with a straight leg. Time progressed and before I knew it I had been training for a good 6 months and my body felt like it never had.

After the first few intense months I modified the workout into a short daily session I do to maintain my body's mobility. I have never since had any significant back pain and people compliment me on 'being such a flexible person' and complimenting me on my 'yoga workouts'.
