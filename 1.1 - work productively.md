# Work productively

Productivity is not about working harder, it is about doing more with less effort. Some people use it to move mountains of work, others use it to free up time for more leisure time. There really is no downside to being able to work productively.

**Principles to work productively**

1. Prioritize effectiveness over productivity
1. A task will expand to fill the time alotted to it
1. Prioritize based on urgency and importance
1. Collaborate and delegate where possible
1. Automate everything possible

## Tools

**Questioning effectiveness**

The following questions will help you prioritise doing the right things, rather that doing the wrong things more quickly.

- Is there any task that will make other tasks obsolete? Start there.
- Which of my tasks will affect me long term? Do them first.
- Can I drop any tasks without serious consequences? Excuse yourself from them.
- Are there any tasks that don't require my expertise? Outsource or delegate them.

**Parkinson's Law**

"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion". So don't give it more time than it needs. I recommend formulating how much time you:

- Think you need
- Are at most willing to spend

For example set a 30 minute timer to process your email inbox.

**Eisenhower Matrix**

| Important? | Urgent? | Example | Action |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------ |
| No | No | Social Media | Don't do them or outsource |
| Yes | No | Exercise | Schedule in as soon as possible |
| No | Yes | Email | Delegate or spend as little energy as possible |
| Yes | Yes | House on fire | Fix this first |

**Collaboration**

With ever task ask yourself: are more people doing this? If the answer is yes, organise a collaboration to eliminate duplicate work. No area of your life is off limits:

- Work
- Household
- Sports club
- And so on
