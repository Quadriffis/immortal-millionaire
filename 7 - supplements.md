# Supplements

Supplements should be exactly what they name implies, supplemental consumptions. They are not designed to replace a varied diet that supplies the nutrients your body needs. They can however offer ways to:

- correct deficiencies
- offer benefits that regular foods do not

## Get your blood tested

Many people seem intent on using supplements blindly. It is in most developed countries however trivial to get a blood panel that tests for useful values.

Note however that blood tests are not like opening the door to a room to see what is inside. You can't just "test your blood" and expect a list of results to come back. You need to test for specific things.

For each of the things you test for there is probably a different test that needs to be run on your blood. It is therefore vital to know what you want to test for.

Some interesting values include common deciciencies like:

- Vitamin d
- Vitamin B12
- Magnesium

Some values are useful simly to have a baseline of your usual values, these include:

- Iron
- Lipid panel (cholesterol etc)
- Certain hormones

Note that not all values have immediate value. Cholesterol values for example are not all that useful for many young people. Having some baseline readings however can be valuable in future scenarios.

## Common deficiencies & supplements

On a statistical basis there are a number of supplements that could benefit a great many people.

Note that statistics can be deceiving. If for example 50% of a population is deficient in vitamin B12, that might convince you to take the supplement. If the underlying data however shows that the 50% that has this issue is over 65 years old, you may or may not change your standpoint.

Don't blindly take supplements:

1. Get your blood tested
2. Make a game plan (supplements/food)
3. Test again a few weeks later

### Vitamin D

Vitamin d is a steroid hormone. That is to say that this substance has the ability to reach the cell nucleus (where the DNA is kept) and unfluence what genes are expressed. In other words: vitamin d changes what part of your DNA is on and off.

Humans have two main sources of vitamin d:

- Food
- The sun

Foods high in vitamin d include for example fatty fish. One stereotypial example is cod liver oil.

Our skin is able to generate vitamin d from sunlight as well. The problem there is that in the recent parts of human existance we've spent a lot of time indoors and covering 90% of our skin surface area with sun blocking clothing.

Some common reasons for low vitamin d levels include:

- Sitting inside all day
- Having darker skin in countries with less sun
- Wearing clothing that covers a lot of skin

The effects of low vitamin d can be manifold (remember, it affects DNA expression):

- Lower mood levels
- Suboptimal immune function
- Suboptimal cognitive function
- Weaker bone and teeth

### Magnesium

This mineral is used in a large amount of functions ranging from the immune system to the brain. It's used ny 300+ enzymes and without it our primary ATP based cellular energy system would not function. 

There are no international population wide statistics on magnesium levels in the blood, but depending on what study you look at as many as 60% to 80% of people care deficient in magnesium.

There are a number of issues for many people:

> Many people don't consume enough magnesium and magnesium supplements are often bad

The issue with magnesium supplements is that different types are absorbed better or worse. Not only that, but it appears that different types are prefered by certain organs.

The important magnesium types to know:

| Type | Bioavailability | Notes |
| --- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Magnesium Oxide | As low as 10% | Basically magnesium rust |

You can check for the type of magnesium in your supplement by checking the ingredient list.

### The harm of supplements

Vitamin supplements are not without risk. Many people approach it with a "worst case it doesn't do anything" attitude. The thing is that vitamins too can upset the balance of your body.

The B vitamin group for example is well known to stimulate certain types of growth. This is why people take it to make nails and hair grow faster/stronger. Hypothetically however these supplements could also provide valuable fuel for tumors.

Likewise for many male consumers taking extra iron is a terrible idea and has shown to increase risk for some disease, whereas this is less so the case for women (who lose iron through menstruation).

> Don't get me wrong: no supplement is inheretly good or bad

Blindly taking highly concentrated supplements is a terrible idea though. Test yourself first.
