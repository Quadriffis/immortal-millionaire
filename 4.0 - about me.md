# About me

I find writing about myself and what I do very challenging. A big part of it is that the way our society tells us to present ourselves tends to not give a good picture of a person. I'll attempt to give you a few different angles and hope that gives you a little insight into the oddball behind this book.

## Education

My primary school was a small establishment in the village right outside our city's border. My class was had a size of 8 people, most of which were girls for the majority of the 8 years of Dutch primary school. In the last two years two other boys joined, one of which became my best friend and the other my bully.

High school in the Netherlands is a very segmented system. From year one onwards you start either on a 4, 5 or 6 year track depending on what your teachers decide you are capable of. My mother asked me if I wanted to do a bilingual high school track geared towards teaching us English by having a large portion of our classes in English. I loved the idea so my mom signed me up. Later I learned this caused quite some drama in my primary school as the teachers there felt bypassed.

In year 4 of 6 we were required to choose between a number of 'profiles' for our continued education. Basically it was a split between the hard sciences like math/physics and what they called 'social subjects' like economics and arts. Me and my friends came to the conclusion that with the science profiles we would be able to pursue any study/career, whereas choosing the social track would limit our options. Needless to say we chose science over society.

Choosing what university to go to and what study to pursue was an interesting process. I held back a grade in the 5th out of 6 years, mostly because of the strain of my parents divorcing that year. In the Netherlands there is no difference in university ranking like in the US or UK, and only very few of those studies had a limit on applicants meaning in practice you could just apply and get in. When reaching the end of high school a number of studies caught my eye, and obviously they were ones that had the most intense selection criteria. My Dutch equivalent of a guidance counsellor kept in different words telling me to set my sights lower. If anything that made me more determined to get in. After visiting the University College in Maastricht (UCM) I had made my decision to go there.

University was a lot of fun. The structure of my degree meant I got to choose my courses every 8 weeks. Basically there were level 1, 2 and 3 courses where to take a level 2 you needed certain level 2's and to take a 3 you needed a number of 2's. The department was mostly social science and humanities, but they had a great selection of sciences. After I found out getting an exemption to prerequisite courses was easy to obtain if you could obtain the course coordinator, I didn't take a single level 1 course in my time there. I spent most of my time learning about human biology like homeostasis, immunology and genetics. Aside from biology I rekindled my interest in computer science with some programming and data-mining courses. Due to the nature of the degree it was mandatory to also take social science and humanities courses. I discovered I liked anthropology and spent a number of courses analysing discourse of science and technology.

During my bachelors degree I learned a lot about nutrition, mostly through experimental science. I decided to on the side do a 1 year course in nutrition. I disagreed with a great part of the course, but finished it anyway. At this point I came to the conclusion that people with a degree in a certain field are not to be trusted if they can't back up their claims with solid references. At the same time it made me more rigorous in finding solid references for the nutrition and health protocols like intermittent fasting I was reading about at the time.

After finishing by bachelors degree I worked for a while and decided to do a masters degree. Honestly the primary reason I did it was because I felt like I would leave something unfinished if I didn't. I worked in Amsterdam at the time and basically filtered masters programs based on the criteria of being a science and taking max 1 year. The result was an information science degree in game studies. That year was very educational and a lot of fun. Learning about the psychology and prototyping of games was very educational, plus I got to play with toys like the latest VR headsets.

## Trampolines and martial arts

I was a very active and mobile kid. One day when I was rolling on the floor my mother asked me if I would like to try trampolining as a sport. It turns out she had done some classes when she was little with a guy that was still teaching. Obviously I said yes. The result is trampolining becoming one of the most impactful elements in my life.

Trampolining is a bit like gymnastics, only there is less stretching and more flipping. I was doing double flips by the time I finished primary school, and developed a keep aerial body awareness.
