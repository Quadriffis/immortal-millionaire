# Increase muscle mass

**Recipe**

1. Verify that you actually want more muscle rather than less fat
2. Trigger muscle growth with resistance training
	- Use the 5x5 rule to determine exercise intensity/weight
	- Focus on technique
	- Use free weights where possible
3. Modify diet to suport muscle growth
	- Protein consumption: 1.4x your lean muscle weight in grams
	- Use the principles of the weight loss section

**Tools**

Suggested exercises[^There are many other great approaches, for example with kettlebells. The same principle applies: train till (near) exhaustion of muscles.]

What matters here is exhausting your muscles with short and intense exercise. For most people talking to a personal trainer at a gym is the best idea (often a single consult is free).

| Exercise | Target |
| -------- | ------ |
| Deadlift | Back, arms, legs |
| Barbell squat | Legs, butt, back |
| Benchpress | Arms, chest |

Suggested dietary practices

| Factor | Recommendation |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Calories | Calculate your BMR. |
| Protein intake | Minimum 1.4 times lean body mass. This is most important. |
| Protein type | High DIAAS score. This is important. |
| Protein timing | Regular if possible, max 40 grams per consumption. This is not high priority. |
| Food types | Low GI, see weight loss section. |

BMR formulas

- Women BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kilos) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years)
- Men BMR = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kilos) + (5 x height in cm) - (6.8 x age in years)

## Why and how this works

Keep in mind that most people don't want more muscle, but rather desire greater muscle definition. The goal there is to reduce fat. For this purpose see the weight loss section.

Before deciding on any course of action, be sure what your goals are. If you want to look in shape, usually losing weight through diet is the best course of action. That doesn't mean you shouldn't do exercise, but rather that you shouldn't rely on exercise alone to look more fit.

### Gaining muscle: 2 variables

To increase your lean muscle mass there are many very effective techniques. They all rely on two basic variables:

1. Trigger muscle growth
2. Supply relevant nutrients

Any training programme that supplies both of the above will yield results. There is no one 'good' way of working out for muscle gain. There are however many bad ways.

### Triggering muscle growth

Triggering muscle growth is simple in principle. You want to send your muscles the signal that they are not sufficient. Exhausting your muscles by doing heavy things basically gives the signal of:

> I had to fight/run for my survival, and these muscles were barely suficient.

By stretching your limits in exercise you tell your body to activate the set of genes that causes the growth of muscles. Some people have easy to trigger genes, meaning a little exercise shows great result. Others need a heavier stimulus.

### Choosing your workout

What matters in choosing your workout is that you train your muscles in a way that exhausts them. Particularly we're not looking for cardio exhaustion (like stationary bikes) but rather muscle exhaustion (resistance/weight training).

A good workout:

- Trains muscle groups
- Exhausts muscles
- Is safe for long term usage

In general it pays off to do exercises that train multiple muscles at the same time. An example would be targetting deadlifts rather than a lower-back only machine. Not only does it mean you target more muscles at once, but it also keeps the muscle growth in balance with the muscles in it's functional vicinity.

For muscle growth an important factor is exhaustion. The more you work you muscles to the 'I can not do this any longer' point the more you're triggering the signal to grow. There is some nuance in this as overtraining is counterproductive. This mostly pertains workout frequency rather than workout intensity though.

Safely is of prime importance. If you do an exercise irresponsibly you will in the best case prevent yourself from working out for a while, and in the worst case cause permanent injury.

To compile your workout the easiest is usually to ask a personal trainer at your gym to help you out. Often you will as you go along learn more and more about fitness and begin to tweak your workout as you go along. There are some recommendations to get you started in the template section.

### Choosing your weight: 5x5

A repetition is one movement (e.g. lifting a weight and putting it down). A set is the number of times you do a rep.

A guideline often used is the 5x5. In essence:

- Find a weight where you can do 2 sets of 5 well
- Do 5 sets of 5 reps
- The last 2 sets or so you should just not be able to make 5

The moment you can do 5 sets of 5 reps, up your weight.

### Supply relevant nutrients

The second factor is feeding your body the building blocks it needs to grow muscle. In simple terms: proteins. There is a lot of nuance there to do with bioavailability and amino acid makeup, but in essence it comes down to those two questions.

Muscles are primarily composed muscle fibers, which are protein structures. When your body is triggered to generate more muscle my exercise, it also needs to get nutrients to work with.

There are two classifications of protein intake that matter when building muscle:

1. Timed protein consumption (less important)
2. Total protein consumption (more important)

Body builders tend to fixate on eating protein before, durng and after a workout. The idea is that exercise causes the body to become catabolic (breaking down muscle) and it needs protein to turn anabolic (building muscle) again.

> From research on exercising while fasting we know that there is little to no loss of muscle when eating nothing for hours before, during and after a workout.

Additionally many try to eat meals every 2-3 hours to 'supply a constant stream of nutrients'. This again stems from the faulty idea that not supplying protein will make the body break down muscle.

> Eating protein every 3 hours is only marginally better than only once or twice a day.

If you want to be a full-time body builder, go ahead and eat meals every few others. If you are a regular human gaining muscle, don't worry too much about meal timing. Rules of thumb:

- Eating some protein after a workout is good, but not doing it is no issue
- Eating protein every few hours only is marginally better for muscle growth
- Having an adequate total protein intake really matters

### Choosing your protein intake

There are two factors in determining your dietary makeup:

- Caloric intake
- Protein intake

From the weight loss section we know that the base metabolic rates for humans are about:

- Women BMR = 655 + (9.6 x weight in kilos) + (1.8 x height in cm) - (4.7 x age in years)
- Men BMR = 66 + (13.7 x weight in kilos) + (5 x height in cm) - (6.8 x age in years)

> For a 26 year old male of 183cm weighing 78 kilos that means a BMR of 66 + (13.7 x 80) + (5 x 170) + (6.8 x 26) = **2188 kCal a day**.

Make sure you eat enough when trying to gain muscle. Keep in mind your exercise expenditure and set a daily target.

The rule of thumb for protein consumption is: 1.4x your lean muscle weight in grams. For example:

> A person weighing 80kg with 15% body fat should take about 80 x 15% x 1.4 = 95 grams of protein.

The above is a rule of thumb. Keep in mind that:

- This is a game of averages, don't go manic on exact numbers
- Protein counts as calories, protein shakes too
- Eating protein without exercise will not make your muscles grow

### Protein quality

Not all protein is created equal. Specifically what matters is the ratio of amino acids and their bioavailability of the source. The currently used method to rate proteins is the *Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score* or DIAAS. It taked into account:

- The amino acid needs of a human
- The degree to which a protein is absorbed by humans

You can look up DIAAS tables online. In general animal source proteins (dairy, meat, eggs) are of the highest biological quality. This is why WHEY protein (dairy source) is very popular in body building.

This doesn't mean that plant proteins don't help muscle growth. It does mean that your body doesn't absorb them as well and might need a very diverse groups of protein sources.

### The (untrue) protein absorbtion limit

There is a lot of untrue common sense out there. In the fitness world it is often referred to as 'broscience'. While it usually doesn't cause any explicit harm, it often tells people to do silly things.

There is no limit to the amount of protein the body can consume in one meal, so no it's not 40 grams. This mantra stems from a misinterpretation of a study that found that 20-40 grams of protein was the most optimal per-meal consumption amount to stimulate muscle growth.

Later studies have found that the body is perfectly capable of absorbing far above 40 grams in one meal. An extreme example is that people who eat one meal a day absorb the protein from their huge meals just fine.
