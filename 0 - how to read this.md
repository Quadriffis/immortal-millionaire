# How to approach this content

Each chapter is written so as to have a 'how to ...' approach. Every chapter has 3 sections:

1. Summary
2. Tools
3. Why & how it works

The summaries are bullet points. They are most valuable once you've read the chapter and want to put it into practice.

The tools sections supply links to interesting external sources of information and tools.

The why & how dissects the reasons behind the summary and dives into the details of operationalising the summary steps.
