# How to approach this content

Each chapter is written so as to have a 'how to ...' approach. Every chapter has 4 sections:

1. The principles in this chapter
2. What you can expect
3. Explanation of each principle
4. How I found out

The information sections are written to contain actionable information.

How I found out sections contain personal stories explaining how I came to the realisations and skills that made me conclude the previous sections.
