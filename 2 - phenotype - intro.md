# Immortality: Setting phenotype goals

This section focuses on how to optimise our bodies with the genetic code we have been given. Specifically:

1. Lifespan
2. Healthspan
3. Aesthetics

Your genotype is the genes you were given at birth. Your phenotype is what you do to activate or supress certain genes. Not all genes are on by default. Many are triggered or deactivated based on choices you make.

**Lifespan**

Humans historically have all died quite reliably[^crispr]. That doesn't mean though that we have no control over the length of our lives. Barring accidents and genetic defects, it is entirely reasonable to expect to exceed the average life expectation by a great deal.

**Healthspan**

What is the point of living longer if you can't enjoy it? Health span is the amount of your life where you are in good health. We can exert a surprising amount of control over our healthspan.

**Aesthetics**

While not essential, many people like looking fit & vital. Be it a well sculpted body or a smooth skin, the aesthetics of the body are to a great extent under our control as well.

[^crispr]: This might not be true in 50 years due to genetic engineering techniques like Crisr.
