# Reach financial independence / retirement (Fi/Re)

Imagine what you would spend your energy on if you didn't have to work to survive. Imagine what you would try to create or achieve if you had a guaranteed income regardless of what work you choose (not) to do. And then open your mind to the possibility that almost everyone can achieve this with the right knowledge.

**Principles of financial independence**

1. Calculate your desired yearly income
1. Invest 25 times your desired yearly income in low cost index funds
1. Consider different types of fi/re

**In this chapter**

- How to calculate the yearly income you need to survive
- Why it is safe to assume a 4% withdrawal rate on your investments
- Why it doesn't matter how long you will live if you use the 4% rule
- How a billionaire and his special ops friend talked me into investing

## Calculate your desired yearly income

Our goal is to create a perpetual money growing tree so that we can become financially independent / retired, abbreviated as fi/re. This is irrespective of age.

The goal of your money tree is to generate money for you. There are 3 steps to building your tree:

1. Calculating the size
2. Growing the tree
3. Eating the fruits forever

For most people retiring on a money tree is feasible, especially if you start early.

There are three money amounts we will calculate that you need in order to reach:

1. Survive - meet your basic needs
2. Thrive - allow you to spend on fun
3. Freedom - let you live your perfect lifestyle

For each of these three we need to come to a specific number.

> **Note:** The below examples will have a lot of holes, they are meant to illustrate the process, not to be 100% accurate.

### Survival: not having to work

Your basic needs come down to food, shelter and obligations. Calculate your monthly cost and multiply by 12 to calculate what yearly income you need.

Things to keep in mind here:

- Rent
- Food
- Insurance
- Non optional costs

**Do not include fun** in here. The idea of your survival number is that you will not go into debt if you stop working. The survival level is not about retirement as such, having this amount will grant you certain perks like:

- No stress over not making rent
- Freedom to quit your job and take months finding your next
- All your income is now available for fun

Make this category as bare bones as possible.

Example for me in Amsterdam:

| Expense | Monthly size in € |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Rent (incl gas/water/electricity) | 780 |
| Food | 200 [^I prefer 400, but can live on 200] |
| Cellphone plan | 15 [^My current one is higher, but at current rates this serves my needs] |
| Healthcare insurance | 100 [^Mandatory by law in the Netherlands] |
| **Total** | €1095 |

€1095 times 12 months equals €13,140. This is the after-tax income I need to survive.

### Thriving: include fun

The second amount we calculate will include the spending desires you have. In this level we include regular stuff you currently do, but not yet your crazy dreams like holiday homes, private islands and space travel.

An example:

| Expense | Average expenditure per month in € |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Massages | 200 |
| Foodie foods | 200 |
| Gym membership | 35 |
| Better healthcare | 50 [^If you are from the US this sounds strange, but maximum healthcare is about 150-200 in the Netherlands including dental etc.] |
| Optional insurances [^Property, travel, etc] | 50 |
| Travel | 200 [^€2400 a year is worth 5-10 trips within Europe.] |
| **Total** | **735** |

Survival (1095) plus fun (735) equals €1830. This equals a yearly (12 months) amount of €21,960.

Note that this number will vary greatly per person and location. Many big city Americans will marvel at the low rent/healthcare/food costs while rural Italians will scoff at these exorbitant numbers.

There are no wrong answers. This is is about how you personally want to live your life.

### Freedom: the dreams

This category is not about spending as much money as possible but rather about fulfilling your dreams. Note that this might take some research.

Many people think they want to buy a yacht to sail the Mediterranean seas. But in the words of secondhand yacht salespeople: *the only days you will be happy about your yacht is the day you buy it and the day you sell it*. For the vast majority of people the cost of maintenance, storage etc is a nightmare.

Think instead about how you can have the *experience* you want. For example:

- Buying a yacht is expensive, renting it for a week is cheaper. Are you really going to spend 6 months a year using it?
- Same for private jets. Chartering a jet often beats owning one.
- House on the beach? If you use it only a month a year perhaps budgeting for a high end airbnb suits you better.
- And so on.

An example calculation:

| Dream | Yearly cost |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Spending winter in Spain | 6000[^3 months of €2000 gets you a sweet time in Spain. Lower cost places like Thailand will be even more extreme.] |
| More massages | 5200[^100 times 52 weeks] |
| City trip every month | 4500[^500 per trip times 9 months (since we are in Spain in winter)] |
| Fun shopping | 12000[^1000 a month seems good to me, maybe you like it higher or lower] |
| **Total** | **€27,700** |

This (€27,700) adds to the previous survival & fun (€21,960) to: €49,660

## Invest 25x your desired yearly income

There is a well established rule in investing that a balanced portfolio can over time safely support a 4% withdrawal rate[^See the 1994 paper "Determining Withdrawal Rates Using Historical Data", http://www.retailinvestor.org/pdf/Bengen1.pdf].

There are many news outlets that will gladly proclaim that the 4% number is wrong because the study is from 1994 where interest rates were higher. These sensationalist non-experts lack long term historical perspective. In fact the original researcher recently crunched the numbers based on recent market data and in his own words:

> The "4% rule" is actually the "4.5% rule"- I modified it some years ago on the basis of new research. The 4.5% is the percentage you could "safely" withdraw from a tax-advantaged portfolio (like an IRA, Roth IRA, or 401(k)) the first year of retirement, with the expectation you would live for 30 years in retirement. After the first year, you "throw away" the 4.5% rule and just increase the dollar amount of your withdrawals each year by the prior year's inflation rate. [^See this wonderful 'Ask me Anything' on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6vazih/im_bill_bengen_and_i_first_proposed_the_4_safe/]

Note for non US citizens: the IRA/401(k) stuff mentioned above is how the US allows its citizens to invest money for their own pensions. Most other countries do not work like this. In the Netherlands for example I can only open a regular investment account and get no tax benefits for saving for retirement.

Of course there are posibilities that a black swan event occurs and everything we thought we knew about money goes out the window. This chance is however quite low and leaves us with no strategy to plan.

**We will act based on the best information available to us.** Which is to assume a 4% withdrawal rate.

Based on the calculations of the previous paragraphs:

| Yearly income | Assumed withdrawal | Needed money tree |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| €13,140 | 4% | €328,500 |
| €21,960 | 4% | €549,000 |
| €49,660 | 4% | €1,241,500 |

A little math trick: to get your money tree size based on 4% take your yearly income and multiple it by 25. (For the math people, this is because 1/.04 = 25)

### Money forever?

But won't your money run out as some point? Not if the 4% rule remains reliable. Take the (simplified) example of €13,140. If your money has an average return of 4%, then every year the tree grows by €328,500 * 4% = €13,140. Which means that when you take €13,140 a year, you are always left with the original €328,500.

But can this really work? Well **the best information we have says yes**.

As Bill Bengen notes[^His specific comment can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6vazih/im_bill_bengen_and_i_first_proposed_the_4_safe/dlz1l6r/]:

>  I find that the state of the "economy" had little bearing on safe withdrawal rates. Two things count: if you encounter a major bear market early in retirement, and/or if you experience high inflation during retirement.

But what about the major financial crashes we've had the past years?

>  So far, I have not seen any indication that the 4.5% rule will be violated. Both the 2000 and 2007 retirees, who experienced big bear markets early in retirement, appear to be doing OK with 4.5%.

His exact words on withdrawals forever:

> If you plan to live forever, 4% should do it.

How do we make sure we get a 4% return while current[^As of 2017] interest rates are under 1%? We'll get to that in the investing chapter.

## Consider different types of fi/re

There are many ways to fi/re. Leanfire defined itself as going fi/re with household expenses < $40,000. Fatfire want to retire with more than that.

There are a class of people that calculate their financial goals not on where they live now, but on where they could live. For example living in Thailand is infinitely cheaper than New York City. I suggest calculating this amount based on where you *currently* live. You can always move.

Finding a low cost of loving (CoL) area to fi/re to can shorten your time horizon greatly. If you live in New York City and pay thousands in rent, moving to a smaller town or even a cheap country could mean you can retire in years instead of decades.

Think well and hard on how and where you want ti fi/re. It can have a large effect on how you will live a great part of your life.

Some things to keep in mind:

- Most people who fi/re keep working anyway, usually on more fun things
- Moving to a different country is nice, but keep in mind travel costs

## How I found out

When I was a little boy I once asked my mother how much money a person needs to never have to work again. We were driving in my hometown at the time so she was focussed on the road. She casually said that she thought she could live a comfortable life on a million guilders (the currency we had before the euro).

At the time I had no conception of how the monetary system works. I had heard banking commercials proclaim "geld moet rollen" (money must roll) and "in het verleden behaalde resultaten bieden geen garantie voor de toekomst" (past results do not guarantee future prospects). As for what they meant, that would take me another decade or two.

The first time I was really confronted with a big savings goal was when I decided I wanted to go to China after high-school to do kung fu in the mountains for a couple of months. My parents supported the idea and promised to finance a part of the trip. It left me to save about two thousand euros in a year. It seemed like infinite money at the time. I worked as a gymnastics teacher after school, and often cleaned houses after those training sessions.

Working hard for the money I needed for my trip gave me the feeling of ownership and pride. It also made me forsake a lot of things I would have bought with the money I made had I had no goal. The insurmountable goal of infinite money (two thousand) started to actually feel within my grasp.

The lessons learned in high-school carried over to my university years. I always kept a budget and most of the time knew exactly how much money I would have left at the end of the month. Then in rapid succession I learned about growing money from some unlikely sources:

- A bitcoin loving billionaire with a penchant of wearing superhero ties (hello Tim)
- A special ops / heart surgeon speech
- A man drawing graphs on a wall

All of them happened when I was attending a programme called Draper University in 2013. I had met the program founder Tim Draper in New York earlier that year. I had no idea who he was at the time. We were having a conversation sitting around a table about the future of 3D printing and what you could do with it. Tim (tall man, superhero tie, big grin) went on to suggest that personalised sex toys would be a terrific idea. He later proceeded to tell some of us at the table to apply for his summer program.

Only later did I learn this particular Tim was one of the founders of the venture capital firm DFJ. As the son of the first venture capitalist he was a bit of a legend in silicon valley. I just knew him as the sex toy guy in my head. When I entered the DU summer program I learned Tim was acquainted with the founder of Jimmyjane, a high end sex toy producer. Suddenly his suggestion made a lot more sense.

While Tim didn't give us investment advice per se, he was a big fan of bitcoin. At the time it was worth about $80 per btc. At the time of writing this it is more like $8000, though it may spike up or downward anytime. His enthusiasm triggered my curiosity and the following months were a bitcoin rollercoaster for me. In the bitcoin world I learned the meaning of:

- Initial Public Offerings (a platform called havelock investments was hosting a bitcoin company only stock market)
- Buy low, sell high as a principle (and failing at implementing it)
- The pain of loving 60% of your wealth within 24 hours
- The value of hodling (not a misspelling)

The months after my DU experience I poured all the money I could into bitcoin. I was riding the wave of crypto hype. I started buying bitcoin at a price of $100 and kept on accumulating until the peak that year of over $1000. Meanwhile those bitcoins were invested in companies that promised ever more bitcoins. Mining companies, bitcoin banks, hardware manufacturers, you name it. I learned to read IPO prospectus papers, valuation graphs, candle sticks and so on. My experience went like this:

- Month 1: buying stocks
- Month 2: OMG I have double money!
- Month 3: I am a professional now, I do IPOs and stuff
- Month 4: I can never lose
- Month 5: Where is all my money?!

You see, I went through a full market cycle and education within the span of a year. The beginning months were a total party. It is what wall street traders in a bull market must feel like. Every stock you pick wins (yay look at how smart you are) and your money grows every single day. Sushi ordered in using bitcoin became very commonplace. My study debt was as good as paid off in my mind.

Then the bubble burst. The mining company I invested in bought old hardware causing the stock to crash, the value of bitcoin dropped, controversy ensued worldwide due to money laundering allegations, etc. etc...

The year after was spent coming to terms with the emotional aspect of investments. I came out on the other side with some solid principles:

- Only invest if you can handle 50%+ fluctuations in price
- If you feel FOMO (fear of missing out), tread extra carefully
- If you make a decision, only act on it when you've slept on it

A number of 'basic' principles I later learned were common advice in the regular stock market:

- Buy low, sell high. When the market is exuberant sell, buy in times of crisis
- Buy things you believe in and hold them (related to the value investing approach)

When all these lessons settled in the final thing I did before deciding to not track the bitcoin world daily was invest in a group of people who promised a thing called Ethereum. A few years of patience was rewarded with a triple digit return on investment factor.

Througout these months I did not reflect on two other pieces of advice I got while in the US. They were very similar suggestions from a guy who everyone called 'doc' and the financial planner of Tim Draper. In short they said to:

- Start investing early
- Invest in index funds

They both did it in their own way, but the message was clear. Don't get burned by waiting to invest, or by trading individual stocks. When looking at large markets the seem to go up and down all the time, but when you zoom out they are trending upward. So don't worry about weekly fluctuations. Invest now and ride the years-long wave of developing markets.

A few years later I read a book called "Money: Master the Game" by Tony Robbins. The book drove home the lessons I had been presented. Within a few days I had:

- Calculated the money I needed to retire
- Opened an investment account
- Set up automated monthly payments to said account

I have since read more and more about investing on a long time horizon, and can only conclude that consistent periodic investment in world index funds is the way to go for the vast majority of people.

I know my own nature though and protect my long term financial health by having a smaller amount of money set aside for risky investments I do for fun.
